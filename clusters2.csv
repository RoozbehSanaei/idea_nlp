0,1,0,[],"-a gondola system like at a ski resort

-it will be high speed and high capacity, holding up to 10 people per cart

-there will be ""Stations"" going from each major neighborhood center going towards major popular destinations like malls, restaurants, etc."
1,1,0,[],A activator people carry around and activate when they need a pickup. A wait time is calculated and shown to them. Something you carry on a key chain and just push a button.
2,1,0,[],A automated truck that delivers groceries and people when bad weather happens and trees are down on the road. Its a big truck that can get through everything
3,1,0,[],A bicycle helmet with speakers and Bluetooth connectivity for your phone.
4,1,0,[],"A bicycle rental system that allows town-owned bicycles to be ""checked out"" at various locations throughout the city, and returned to any of several locations. This will encourage people to ride bikes, even if they do not own them themselves."
5,1,0,[],A bicycle rickshaw service.
6,1,0,[],A bicycle service for when you are not in a hurry.
7,1,0,[],A bicycle taxi service
8,1,0,[],A bicycle that can lock itself when the owner forgets to lock it.
9,1,0,[],"A bicycle that is completely powered using solar batteries. Therefore, it needs neither peddling nor gasoline for it to keep going."
10,1,0,[],A bicycle with spheres instead of wheels
11,1,0,[],A bicycle-only highway.
12,1,0,[],"A big massive trailer with comfortable seats, and a breakfast bar that you can sign up for so it comes to your house, or a predetermined bus stop at a certain time.  Everything is reserved so you must opt in.  On the bus there is simple things, such as bagels/croissants/danish etc.  It's a good way to grab a quick bite to eat before work, and wake yourself up with some coffee.  The bus will use an algorithm to determine people to put on the bus that are on the way to the same destination, or a similar destination, while not going too far out of the way to pick them up."
13,1,0,[],A bike path that has a divider between the road and the bike path. A dedicated bike path that has a sense of security could encourage more people to bike around town since they wouldn't need to share the road with cars.
14,1,0,[],A bike path that is in place of all the roads. No cars will be allowed. There will be no worrying about being hit by a car when riding your bike.
15,1,0,[],"A bike rental service that lest customers rent bikes for reasonable rates daily or weekly, with pick up and return spots very conveniently located around the city"
16,1,0,[],A bike with jet packs
17,1,0,[],"A board that can actually hover above the ground, perhaps I'm thinking of a jet pack. But it would be something that would allow the rider to maneuver around slightly above the ground."
18,1,0,[],"A both walking and bike lane that provides safety from traffic, is well lit, and connects key locations around the neighborhood."
19,1,0,[],A bunch of self driving cars that will replace buses and taxis. The will have free wifi and be very cheap.
20,1,0,[],"A bus system similar to a paternoster, but horizontal instead of vertical. This would be a system of interconnected cars with seats that would follow along a set track in a loop, and always be running, so people would just walk on and walk off the system when they reached their stop - no stopping and starting."
21,1,0,[],a bus system that lets you rack up points for rewards
22,1,0,[],"A Bus system, within the metro area that was funded by a tax on gas purchased by individual commuters. In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."
23,1,0,[],"A bus that has a design similar to a hydrofoil boat. The bus would run on special tracks that would be parallel to each other on opposite sides of a street. This passenger compartment would be on top, with the ""foils"" connecting to the two tracks. There would be open space underneath the passenger compartment where the road is. This way, the bus could move unimpeded by traffic, while also not disrupting traffic itself. Also, passengers would not even see the traffic below them, making the ride smooth, comfortable, and consistent."
24,1,0,[],"a bus that has little cars in it to take people different places, and once it lets them out the car returns to the bus for others"
25,1,0,[],"A bus that is programed to do the fastest route possible for what people need. There is a station where they push their destination, and a program figurs out who needs to go where and the best way to do it. Reduces wait time and makes more people want to use it."
26,1,0,[],A bus with 8 off road tires and a strong engine that could easily get the passengers through even the snowiest of days. We can call it the Wolverine.
27,1,0,[],A bus with live performers
28,1,0,[],A cab system which optimizes fares by calculating the best way to get multiple people to their destination. It's like a bus but it doesn't follow a route.
29,1,0,[],A car pool van that does loops around our town picking up kids and dropping them off at various activities. There can be an app that works to hail the van and parents can track where its going
30,1,0,[],"A car pooling app. Non-drivers and those looking for regular rides who normally carpool would join the community and hook up with drivers who are going to their general destination. There would be a monthly fee, which would lowered and even be removed if someone drives/uses their car enough. For example, it's $5 per month, and every time YOU drive it goes down by .50 cents. There's incentive for both non-drivers (a small fee for rides) and drivers (free membership, maybe some gas reimbursement)."
31,1,0,[],A car that scans particular people before allowing it to run to prevent thieves.
32,1,0,[],"A car that woeks with the magnetic forces of earth, applying a system that can take advantage of all the force that can be generated. It can also work with other alternative energies such as solar power or wind power. All of these energies mixed in one idea and also fossil fuels but to a minimum scale."
33,1,0,[],A cargo bike rental that came with discounts at supermarkets and hardware stores.
34,1,0,[],A carpool app. It has profiles of possible matches and helps match up route schedules.
35,1,0,[],"A central hub for a ridesharing service that provides cars for small groups to take to neighboring towns. I live in a rural area, a few minutes from a very small village. The nearest SMALL city is about 30 minutes away, and the nearest decent sized city is almost an hour away. A ridesharing service would make accessing these places much easier, and if the company provided the car (for a fee, of course), those without vehicles could be serviced."
36,1,0,[],"A chair lift system to get from point a to point b, with multiple stops along the way if you need it."
37,1,0,[],a chute system with high travel.
38,1,0,[],A circular bicycle that everyone pedals together.
39,1,0,[],"A circulatory bus system consisting of two vehicle traveling in opposite directions on a set route but with no designated stops. The route in my small district of the city takes approximately 20 minutes to to circumnavigate and consists of goth commercial districts. One would never be more than 10 minutes fro being able to hail the ""jitney"" bus. This alleviates the use of regular bus system which is much more focused on funneling clientele to central city and runs more or less eradicately.It envisions using current tech and is human centered. It is innovative in it's goals not hardware."
40,1,0,[],A city bus that has entertainment in it like movies and music
41,1,0,[],A civilian shuttle service that is cheaper when compared to Uber or Lyft that has a specific destination (i.e. the airport or certain resort stops). It would hold around 40 passengers and you'd have to call it in advance as if scheduling an appointment. Anyone can use it and seniors and disabled would receive discounts.
42,1,0,[],A community carpool.
43,1,0,[],A community system that is managed electronically and requests cars any time of day. All cars are electric and will take you anywhere you want to go for a set charge and there are maintenance teams that come and clean cars during the day.
44,1,0,[],A company that picks you up in a car of your choice.
45,1,0,[],"A concept similar to Uber, but with a bus. Especially in a city the socialization factor of riding with other passengers while going to a destination could be nice. You would be able to specifically request stops and pickups."
46,1,0,[],"A conveyor belt system like the airport set up like the nyc trains would be awesome.  A bit slow going, but cheap, affordable, and it would allow people to be out in the fresh air again."
47,1,0,[],A covered moving sidewalk that allows you to walk on it as well so you get to where you need but also get exercise. It would run throughout the city.
48,1,0,[],A crowd-sourced bus stop app. Instead of having fixed bus stops throughout the city. People through a smart phone app request a bus to stop at a certain locations. This would provide information to the bus service company in improving the locations and times of where service is needed the most.
49,1,0,[],A crowdfunding site that tries to solve mini societal problems. It's like a non-government organization but this tries to solve mini problems such as buying a net for a local basketball court or a reforestation project.
50,1,0,[],"A device that monitors all your vital signs (pulse, blood pressure, body temp, etc) and is connected to a smart phone app that lets you easily share the info with your doctor."
51,1,0,[],A disaster movie about a blimp that gets a slow leak.  Most of the movie will take place in the cockpit.  It will be conversational based between the pilots and air traffic control.
52,1,0,[],"A driverless mini-coach will be the norm. Summoned through an ""uber"" type app, the responding vehicle will be selected based on pickup and destination points. All riders will be photoed and violators cited."
53,1,0,[],A drone system where small helicopters would come down and pick up people. It would work like a bus in that it takes people to drone stops.
54,1,0,[],A drone taxi that picks you up and drops you off at your desired location.
55,1,0,[],A electric scooter sharing program for getting around town without having to drive a car and use too much gas or take up too much space.
56,1,0,[],"a fan that goes on top of your outdoor HVAC unit. The exhaust from the HVAC turns the fan, which then generates electricity."
57,1,0,[],"A fare based system would allow heavy car users to pay more and light ones to pay less for gas, tolls, etc.  Their car will have a gps tracker to see where and when they go (downtown, rush hour, etc.)  This will help the people who don't need to drive as much and tax the ones that are always on the road."
58,1,0,[],"A fleet of automated cars that have pre-programmed destinations in them. You use your credit or debit card to pay. Swipe it and then pick your destination and it takes you there, charging you based on how far away it is and not based on time so it's better than a cab, and also uses the new robotic cars."
59,1,0,[],"A fleet of cheap, reliable, automated taxi cars. The cars would drive automatically after an input was made for the destination. These cars would be self charging with paint that has solar energy potential."
60,1,0,[],a fleet of pedicabs
61,1,0,[],"A fleet of smart, autonomous busses."
62,1,0,[],A flexible public transport system that shuttles students from my neighborhood to the school
63,1,0,[],A flying bike that can come straight to you with a click of a button from your phone or tablet.
64,1,0,[],a flying car to dodge traffic
65,1,0,[],A flying car would be a good innovation. We would free up the roads making less traffic jams and it'd give people new experiences.
66,1,0,[],"A form of alternative transportation would be in the form of an SUV crossed with a 4wheeler. However, it would need to be affordable and able to be driven on main roads."
67,1,0,[],"A form of transportation similar to an airlift, only the seats are at terminals on the ground. You board and they take you to predesignated stops in a direct line, free of traffic. Like a shuttle or train, only on a smaller scale, and ideally seats come in much more frequently, every 30 seconds or so."
68,1,0,[],"A free taxi service for students, especially for nights so that students can get back safely. Instead of a car or a big bus, it could be a small bus so that it can fit enough people, but not use too much gas."
69,1,0,[],a fun car that always tells jokes to the passengers
70,1,0,[],"A futuristic railway that could stop at different stops depending on if people are their or now, it could run on renewable energy and stop every quarter mile."
71,1,0,[],A giant water slide that takes you from tower to tower in a city
72,1,0,[],A going to town app. In a rural area like where I live sometimes you avoid going to town because you don't have a ride or you just don't feel you can justify driving all that way just to run a quick errand. Enter an app that connects you to people along your travel rout who also need to go into town. You could flag yourself as offering a ride or needing a ride.
73,1,0,[],A golf cart-like train that circles the small town I live in on a regular basis.
74,1,0,[],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
75,1,0,[],"A group carpooling smartphone app that allows people in apartment complexes or housing areas to visualize a profile of others in the area that are traveling to a nearby destination. Participants can communicate over the app, and background check and everything is done before being certified to use the service. People can post looking for ride notes, or say that they are traveling to a specific area and looking for passengers to ride in order to split costs."
76,1,0,[],A high speed conveyor belt that travels through peoples' houses that can take people to city centers.
77,1,0,[],A high speed monorail system that winds its way through all the important points of interest in the city. It would look futuristic and high tech with a sophisticated level of design along with being reliable.
78,1,0,[],A high speed train/subway that links all the cities in the Detroit metro area.
79,1,0,[],A high-speed rail that goes around the neighborhood into the city.
80,1,0,[],"A hitchhiking app where everyone has a profile with ""reviews"" from other drivers and hitchhikers. If you're walking somewhere you can turn on the app and if someone else with the app happens to drive by they can pick you up."
81,1,0,[],A horse drawn carriage would be nice
82,1,0,[],A hover board sharing service. Like a car rental but with hover boards. Must be located near bike paths.
83,1,0,[],A hoverboard lane just like bikers!
84,1,0,[],A hoverboard that is powered by solar power
85,1,0,[],A hovering scooter with its own lane on the roads
86,1,0,[],"A human carrying drone. This would require it to be build and withstand certain weight thresholds, such as up to 200 pounds. You would call a drone in and let it know where you want to go. It would pick you up and fly you there at a decent rate of speed and without having to sit in traffic."
87,1,0,[],A human taxi system like they have in Asian countries. A guy can run around with a cart and pick up passengers.
88,1,0,[],"A human tube system, similar to televison shows like Futurama, and already in use by banks, albeit for parcels and not people. If we installed vacuum tubes that led to a multitude of central destinations, we could develop a toll system alongside it. Using air pressure would cut out emissions immensely, and would be relatively fast, allowing for faster travel times than traditional modes of transportation. However, the difficulty would come from utilizing the system in such a way that remained safe for all those involved, perhaps through making use of a stop and go turbine system, that worked similarly to a stop light. A smart air restriction system would allow for one way travel, and then a short delay, followed by travel in the other direction."
89,1,0,[],"A human-sized slot-car system.  Where cars run independently self-driving down a track through electricity like a trolley car, but just big enough for a regular sized family (in other words size of a regular car).  In order to move faster cars can link up by matching speed and then essentially ""plugging"" into the car ahead of it.  This could go much faster than regular cars and not have any of the problems associated with regular self-drive cars seeing as they move on a track."
90,1,0,[],a hyper tube that transports people though air
91,1,0,[],A imagine a system like Ã¼ber but with driverless technology. And I imagine people renting on car for a group of people to commute.
92,1,0,[],"A jitney that makes local stops within a few miles of a small town.  My town would be perfect as an example.  Most errands can be run in a 10 mile radius.  This includes, post office, shopping centers, DMV, library, etc.  there could be a call in to meet at nearest cross stop.  We have 2 main roads that run through town so this would be very easy to implement."
93,1,0,[],"A large network of rails traveling from downtown to every other part part of the surrounding area featuring energy efficient, sleek that arrive every ten to twenty minutes at each station"
94,1,0,[],"a large open vehicle that moves slowly on wheels around the downtown area, carries about 25 people"
95,1,0,[],A larger bike path so that more people could ride their bikes places. Also every few miles they could have a bench for people to rest with a water fountain.
96,1,0,[],a lazy river in the summer would be a fun way to get around
97,1,0,[],"A light rail from city center to neighboring suburbs that would replace thousands of commuters and make rush hours less crowded and stressful. This could be as simple as one station in each suburb (thus 10-15 total stations), or a more complex system with multiple stations in each suburb."
98,1,0,[],A light rail that goes around town quickly and efficiently with routes that will help the people who use it most.
99,1,0,[],"A local-government sponsored ridesharing service, much like Uber. However, the proprietors will be the local government, so the commissions from rides will be reinvested into the local community."
100,1,0,[],"A magnetic railway car, like a trolley, that moves and stops by people pressing buttons on the side of the road"
101,1,0,[],"A magnetic roadway system, where people move in modular pods that are controlled by a central operating system (COS). Magnets underneath the street guide your pod along, and every movement of all of the pods is controlled perfectly by the computerized system, it is completely autonomous. If your whole family wants to go into town, you assemble your four-pod system and take off, where traffic is optimized perfectly by the COS. If just you are on your way to work, you hop in your single passenger pod, and take off!"
102,1,0,[],A map that has the location of buses currently running so that you can see how long it takes for your bus to reach you while waiting for the bus.
103,1,0,[],"A monorail sort of train, raised over the cityscape and nearly silent as it passes overhead.  There would be platforms raised up several stories high, with elevators to reach street level.  The trains would be sleek and shiny silver or white, gleaming in the sun.  The trains would change smoothly and seamlessly from track to track, so that each one can have a different route."
104,1,0,[],"A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.  They would park their cars before entering the city, and use this quick system for getting around.  No more crowded, expensive parking in the city."
105,1,0,[],A monorail type transportation system.
106,1,0,[],"A more affordable public transit (or shuttle bus) that is crowdsourced/crowdfunded and takes passengers anywhere within a certain radius (e.g. 30 mile radius, etc.)."
107,1,0,[],"A more thorough bus system with buses running more frequently and covering a wider area.  Other modes would not be feasible for this area.



An Uber-type crowd-sourced system for carpooling."
108,1,0,[],"A motorized scooter ""stop.""  Basically a few very popular areas you can pick up a scooter from an agent.  Credit is the only thing that's acceptable, as they need to have something on file in case you ride off with the scooter.  These locations where you can both rent, and return scooters will only be in very popular areas (Such as the mall, a large amount of business buildings, and the like.)  Make it relatively affordable, and have people be able to write it off as an expense."
109,1,0,[],A motorized scooter program where  you can rent them from stations throughout the city.
110,1,0,[],"A moving sidewalk - like the ones you would see in an airport to help expedite movement between terminals.  Around my area there are a lot of close shops, so people could walk, but getting loads of bags home would be difficult.  Having mechanical walkways would enable people to do their shopping but reduce their need to use cars, and at the same time set all their bags down so they don't have to figure out how to lug them home, especially if they've purchased something heavy.  It could also allow people to get where they need to go faster, if they continue to walk along the moving sidewalk.  They could sit alongside regular sidewalks, so people who still wanted to go out for a walk and get some fresh air could do so.  The mechanical/moving sidewalks would be made out of metal, look like a flat escalator, have hand railings, and each side of the road would have a sidewalk that goes the same way as traffic."
111,1,0,[],A moving sidewalk could be useful in some areas of my neighbourhood.
112,1,0,[],A moving sidewalk outside main street.
113,1,0,[],"A moving sidewalk with seats.  You could get on and off easily.  In the high density corridor, this sidewalk would have seats that you sit on and would move you down the corridor.  Getting a person with a wheelchair four blocks can be a big problem.  You would just roll onto this moving sidewalk and they would be moved."
114,1,0,[],A much-improved subway.  It is faster and has far fewer delays than the current line.  It is also relatively affordable.
115,1,0,[],"A multiple person bike system that converts all the energy created in a moderate speed. This system has an own lane and its free for users, its an ecological way to get to any given detination."
116,1,0,[],"A mutli-layed monorail system that is solar and wind powered. I leave in las vegas, which has a centralized population. It would go up and down the strip and between the strip and downtown and around the city."
117,1,0,[],"A network of green transportation for rent. You insert coins and it releases a bike, a skateboard, a scooter or some other form of efficient transportation. You drive it to your destination and once you deliver it to the hotpspot you can get your money back, if it is in good condition."
118,1,0,[],A network of publicly available electric cars will drive around the city in the most efficient manner possible. People will use apps to call a car to get them =from one of many pickup spots and drop them off before they go on the next passenger.
119,1,0,[],"A network of quadcopters (drones) large enough to transport humans. Let's say you need to get to the other side of town quickly, and want to avoid traffic -- get in a drone and have it deliver you by air!"
120,1,0,[],"A network of roads that we all on different levels depending on which direction you were going, so that there were never any stops that needed to be made, simply merging onto an onramp/offramp which takes you up or down a level or two and allows you to then merge onto the new direction you are desiring to travel."
121,1,0,[],"A network of self driving cars on demand.  You set your pickup time and location via app, as well as destination and desired arrival time."
122,1,0,[],"A network of self driving cars that are owned by the community. When you need one, you just summon one like Uber."
123,1,0,[],A new bus route that could go through my town. It would have a different route than the buses we currently have.
124,1,0,[],A new carpool system. You get together with a group of people at a park and ride. Park your car there and commute in a van with a group of people to work. This save gas and some of you can nap while the other is driving.
125,1,0,[],A new form of transportation that could be well used in my community would be a large seating vehicle that took people on and off the local military bases. There are 5 bases here and in the morning and evening commute there are traffic issues around those bases. A way to remove at least half the vehicles could cut down on pollution and traffic around the base for people off the base as well as on. This would be a military carpool of sorts to also eliminate parking issues.
126,1,0,[],A new innovative transportation system would be automated cars. They can pick you up and drop you off wherever you need to be.
127,1,0,[],A new railway system! We don't have any trains or railways anywhere near the area I live in.
128,1,0,[],"a new system in my neighborhood could be bicycle - but have taxi options, so additional seats attached, perhaps rickshaw style. A person would pedal (no motors, so no issues with being on road) and there would be a seat on the back for a rider. There would be a helmet with each rider."
129,1,0,[],A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
130,1,0,[],"A new taxi service that uses mopeds rather than cars. It's something used quite frequently in other countries (such as Brazil). You would be able to call for assistance or simply stop them off the side of the road (just like a taxi, obviously)."
131,1,0,[],"A new transportation idea would be to have bikes that can be rented.  I have seen this in some towns such as Austin, Texas.  Where you can find a bank of rental bikes every couple of blocks.  How awesome would it be if this was more normal and people could choose to ride a bike to the store to grab a loaf of bread or something, rather than getting in the car and wasting gas and adding to pollution."
132,1,0,[],"A new transportation method could be using self driving vehicles. During times when you are needing to pre drink before going to a bar to save money, you find yourself unable to drive to the said bar. With self driving vehicles, you can let the robot do the critical thinking for you to ensure your safe arrival to your friendly neighborhood bar. This would be fun and convenient. This would also reduce the amount of wrecks on a friday and saturday night."
133,1,0,[],"A new transportation system  can be something somewhat like a train, but a small train like shuttle, which can take others around the neighborhood, easy, fast and no traffic."
134,1,0,[],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
135,1,0,[],A new transportation system for our neighborhood could be shared scooters.  The scooters would be open for all to use and stocked at locations around the neighborhood.  You could check them out and return them for less money than the cost of a scooter.
136,1,0,[],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood could be the use of drones to fly individuals in and around town, or to far off destinations. The drones would fly like helicopters, but can  can also be controlled using a remote control. Unlike a car which can transport several passengers, the drone would be only be able to transport one person."
137,1,0,[],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
138,1,0,[],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
139,1,0,[],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be similar to a train line, just on a smaller scale. It would pick people up in a series of pods and deposit them at their place of work for a small fee. This new train type line could also be used in the same way that a bus is, to run errands. The new system would have comfortable couch like chairs and be far more acceptable than the current forms of trnasportation availabe."
140,1,0,[],"A new transportation system uses solar panel on the roads to empower vehicles to travel around the city. As vehicles get on the road, it automatically connects on the server of the roads and energies stored on boxes on street corners come one. These vehicles do not use gasoline, ethanol or diesel. It is greenhouse and uses electricity collected from the sun. Renewable energy that saves money and free to the entire residents meaning as long as the sun still shines, vehicles will work."
141,1,0,[],"A new transportation system would be a large electric powered bus. It would not run on gasoline but on electricity. It would pick people up from stops and drop them off for a fee.

197,1,0,[],A sidewalk peoplemover based system that could run parallel to the road or existing sidewalk.
198,1,0,[],A sidewalk that is automatic.  It could allow people to get around faster than what walking would do.  It also would help others with being able to carry things that they couldn't possibly carry all by themselves.  It could help with getting people where they need to go at the rate of speed as a bicycle.  This would help out tons of people that have had a rough tiring day but don't want to use a vehicle to get back home.
199,1,0,[],A simple roapway made up of strong steel cable and a cabin controlled by rope. This can be operated downhill and uphill.

201,1,0,[],A ski lift type tram.
202,1,0,[],A small personal car that ran on solar energy that was no larger than a bike.  It could be stored on a bike rack and had enough energy to go 15 miles on a charge.  Charging time would only be an hour if and when it needed to plug into electric.  The biggest thing is that it would keep the occupant dry.

211,1,0,[],"A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
212,1,0,[],"A sort of rail line, but it's a single rail and has many hanging carts. The carts hold maybe 4 people at a time, like a taxi. The price would be cheaper than a bus and they would arrive quickly when you need them. You could push a button on poles that are located around the city, far more often than bus stops, and the cart will come to you quickly and take you directly to your destination. No need for bus drivers or waiting for traffic!"
213,1,0,[],A sort of snowmobile with wind protection and heated so you can get to work or the store on days when we've had a lot of snow. I live in Michigan and there are days when you can't get out of your driveway.
214,1,0,[],"A specific lane in which you have to pay money to use.  It could be like 30-40 a month, there is a microchip in the car that can tell if you don't belong there, and it alerts the police.

223,1,0,[],A super quick train that would be lightning fast
224,1,0,[],"A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."
225,1,0,[],A system in which no one leaves their house ever. Everything they need is brought to them by drones. They never need to leave even for vacation because virtual reality is so realistic.

228,1,0,[],A system of fast moving conveyor belts that help move people quickly instead of walking and driving short distances.
229,1,0,[],A system of mopeds that you leave at different stations and ride around on only paying to rent them
230,1,0,[],"A system of neighborhood drivers who form a cooperative and use their own vehicles to provide transportation services. We live in a community of 1875 people in a rural area, it may not be practical, but it is doable."
231,1,0,[],A system where cars are left with the keys in them but they require a passcode to unlock that is only obtained by renting the car. It can then be parked in special spots around the city for the next person to use.
232,1,0,[],"A system where there are rails above you and nothing underneath you.

You sit in a cart of sorts and you are guided along near the streets, maybe above the streets or sidewalk.

The railings connect overhead and end at each sidewalk and gives you a nice view of the neighborhood, kind of like a ski-lift."
233,1,0,[],A system with bike racks so people can rent bikes and ride around would be nice. There can be multiple areas to be rented from.
234,1,0,[],"A tax write-off for driving strangers to work.  This way, the stranger doesn't have to pay for the ride, the person driving still gets ample benefit for dropping someone off on the way to their job and the like.  There could be a little schedule online you fill out saying where you're going, and at what time.  



People who are interested in being helpful can go to this site, find out whats on their way, and scoop up the people.  Think uber, but instead of money, just get a dollar or two back on your taxes for every single person you pick up.



You'd be able to rate the drivers, and in order for them to be eligible for the write off, they'd need to maintain a high rating.  If anyone abuses it, or misses picking people up, they are barred from using it for a few months."

239,1,0,[],A train that runs hovering above its track on magnetic bearings traveling at near supersonic speeds
240,1,0,[],"A train to the beach.  The beach is about an hour from our town (or three hours with summer traffic), and all traffic to the beach comes through our town due to an important bridge.  We could have a train that leaves from our town, or other stops nearby, and then expresses to the beach.  People would need extra room for luggage - or you could couple it with a luggage delivery system.  It would cut down on time to the beach and the number of cars on the road."
241,1,0,[],"A train would be useful in my city. It would be most useful to travel out to other nearby cities. Traffic is extremely bad on the interstate where I live, and a train would be incredibly useful for traveling to the popular cities surrounding my city."

243,1,0,[],A tram system that is operated by a robot where you can stop as you please and not at stations
244,1,0,[],"A tram. We don't really have trams in the Ohio. It's kind of like a smaller version of a train, but very quiet and low energy. It runs on tracks and electricity."
245,1,0,[],A transportation Idea I have is to have networked building walkways. Think of it like your average street crossing but instead of connecting streets it connects neighboring buildings instead. There would be no access to private buildings but pedestrians would be able to walk enclosed walkways running through special areas in the building to get to the next. I think this idea is very practical in heavy urban areas and would be a refreshing change from the average commute.
246,1,0,[],"A transportation system would include wide use of self-driving cars to facilitate efficiency and safety. Cars may be privately owned, or there may be a pay-as-you go or contract type system if you do not wish to own a vehicle. There would also be a total bike lane system for those who prefer to ride bicycles. The bike lanes would be much safer than what exists now."

264,1,0,[],"A walking pathway across every rooftop in the city.   It would cut down on danger from cars, and it'd be fun to see the scenery.  This could easily be constructed with some good, sturdy planks.  Line them up on the roof, screw them in or hammer them in.  Every building would have a fire escape on it for easy access back to the street.  This would save much time as you could go ""as the eagle flies."" straight across the roofs."
265,1,0,[],"a walkway above the road. it would be totally enclosed and go parallel to the road, not across the road. so people can walk to work/down the main drag without being outside. this would facilitate walking to work."

271,1,0,[],"A zip line from the place where I take the bus to the subway would be great. It would cut out all the traffic and possibly be much faster than taking the bus to the subway. Also, there would be multiple pods that would lock in the destination and go non-stop so it wouldn't be stopping every few minutes to pick up passengers."

Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."
302,1,0,[],"An autonomous car service. This would require the building and investing into self driving cars. You would have a mobile app you can call and request a car and one is immediately dispatched to you. Using your phone you tell it where you want to go. It navigates there. Best of all, this would be free - or very cheap."

326,1,0,[],"An underground tunnel system just for people, bikes and mopeds.  The idea is that all the cars and congestion can stay up above and people can safely walk or transport themselves around without worrying about cars and busses getting in the way or being run over by them.  Every so often there is a ramp that allows you to exit, as well as natural light through grates and proper ventilation.  It would also be a great way to get around when it snows."

They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
334,1,0,[],"As a networking solution, all cars produced after 2017 whether self-driving or not will be installed with small wi-fi repeaters that work on the new bandwidth. They will broadcast wifi from 100 meters in each direction. The tech will be an industry standard and will be powered on at all times anonymously. Funding will come from tolls from my tube idea."

I'd like to be able to pick my music genres for the ride as well."
336,1,0,[],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."

There could be a network of ride sharing. Sort of like if Uber was a bus. People would have a regular route and others would request a ride to a central location. It would be mostly people commuting to work together. This would be done through phone apps."
459,1,0,[],"flying scooters, whenever the rider can not find a place to ride, he can turn it into flying mode"
460,1,0,[],Flying taxi cars?
461,1,0,[],"flying transportation system will be very famous in future for example flying car, flying scatter board bike and so"
462,1,0,[],Footpath that moves like an escalator. You get on the footpath which has arrow on it show the direction in which it moves. You will be able to turn with the help of remote control. Has a stop button in case of emergency. And must be solar powered.
463,1,0,[],For the future we introduce solar bikes.
464,1,0,[],"For transportation in my neighborhood we have cars, and buses. The most popular mode of transportation being the four door family sedan type car. Following that it's the minivan and then the four-door trucks. They can be seen whizzing back and forth on the roads causing many traffic jams during peak morning hours."
465,1,0,[],Free bike exchange drop off type situation with buy in.  I'd like to pay a small fee to get a key to buy into a bike exchange that would be availible outside a number of locations spread thoughout the small city to use when i wish.
466,1,0,[],Free car services to parents with kids in school.  Too cold to walk in the frigid weather.
467,1,0,[],"From small towns to big cities, public transportation is helping to generate new vitality like never

before. Beautiful, walkable town squares combine residential, retail, office, recreation and public

transportation features to make community living easy. New bus services and light rail extensions

improve mobility and ease congestion. Even the smallest adjustments, like widening sidewalks and

adding bikeways, can provide dramatic impact and value."
468,1,0,[],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
469,1,0,[],"Future cityscapes will be re-designed in such a fashion where all transportation will be as efficient as possible, through grouping all businesses, schools, hospitals, etc. together in different districts/areas. All transportation will be through public modalities, no private modes of transportation will exist."
470,1,0,[],Future transportation in my neighborhood would be by air. Cars will travel in the air and park on top of roof buildings. Gas would not cost that much and it will be less crowed on the streets.
471,1,0,[],Future transportation is the Shower transporter. You get ready for where you want to go and then simply hop in the shower and press a button to be teleported to your pre-progammed destination. E.g. you will have regular places like your work and supermarket already programmed in with addresses. The shower will pop out through your roof and drop you off at your destination by taking the sky-way and then return home. Just remember to take your shower calling watch with you to buzz your shower teleport back when you want to return home. No more traffic no more waiting no more parking just flying showers :)
472,1,0,[],Future transportation system in my neighborhood could be a electric bicycle taxi system where neighborhood resents can take shorts trips like the grocery store or sending kids off to school.
473,1,0,[],Future transportation will be cleaner and more environmentally freindly. Cars will run on less fuel and will have better emissions
474,1,0,[],Get scientists to develop teleportation technology so eventually people can use personal teleporters to go wherever they want.
475,1,0,[],"Get some large vans and people who are going to the same general area to work can all ride together.  They take turns driving.  It'll be like kids' school buses but for adults.  It'll save money and help bond co-workers together.  There will be enough room for a lot of people so the chances of an incident are slim.  It'll also help when it's bad weather because some people are afraid to drive in it and this would ease some of that stress.  Plus, they could all share in the maintenance and gas for the bus/car so that could save them a lot of money."
476,1,0,[],Giant swings. You can jump off at the peak of the swing and go down big slides to end up on the sidewalks
477,1,0,[],Give people segways or hoverboards and then have a transport for those smaller transportations methods. Sort of like a car-carrier or bus that you board with your segway or hoverboard.
478,1,0,[],"Golf carts - I think these are amazing vehicles that are being under-utilized in America.  They would be great in urban, suburban and rural communities alike.   There are many uses in modern America that these vehicles could fill and reduce the high costs of maintaining the automobiles, trucks and other motor vehicles we all use for errands, travel to work, etc."
479,1,0,[],good idea
480,1,0,[],Governments could offer tax incentives for individuals willing to give up their personal vehicles in favor of public transport or other environmentally friendly methods of commuting.
481,1,0,[],Group carpools to work.  There could be an app that puts you in contact with people who work at the same company you work at or in close proximity to your work location.  The app would allow drivers to sign up to drive to work and with a rotating schedule this would cut down the amount of driving that any one single person would have to do.
482,1,0,[],"Gyroscopic personal vehicles. These devices would generate a magnetic field in opposition with the earth's magnetic field, creating levitation and allowing for free and easy transportation."
483,1,0,[],"Handicapped taxi. Public transportation is awful in my area, so if you are in a wheelchair then you need an expensive handicapped van just to be able to get around. Some taxi wheelchair van options would be great for people who can't afford a $30,000 wheelchair van and might otherwise have a hard time getting around."
484,1,0,[],Have a beer machine. You pay for a beer but the person before you picks the one you get. Then you get to choose the one the next person gets. It'll be in a bar or something so that people will be adequately drunk. It will be an easy subject matter for two people to talk about.
485,1,0,[],"Have a business where drivers rent cars, for hours and not days. The cars can be electric cars. Make them the cheapest cars possible. Make it for around the metro area only - and have the credit card swiper built into the car itself. In other words If you rent three hours with the car, it goes dead until you pay for more time. If someone takes it out of the pre-defined boundaries  of the city the car goes dead. You would have these little rental kiosks set up all over the city."
486,1,0,[],Have a monorail system around town. It'll reduce pollution because people will have fun using it instead of driving their cars.
487,1,0,[],Have a system of moving sidewalks that has chairs (with seatbelt for safety) mounted to it. People can just sit down and be transported quickly throughout the city.
488,1,0,[],Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
489,1,0,[],Have a system of skylift that can transport people within the city. This could really reduce traffic congestion. This network goes above the ground traffic and moves quickly.
490,1,0,[],"Have a transportation system in the city where there is a tunneling system filled miniature train with small passenger capacity. These miniature trains can take people directly to their destination and the best part is that because they are small, there can be a large number of them running underneath the city."
491,1,0,[],Have an app for parents of kids who go to the same school where they can carpool and share rides to the same events. I live in a climate where these is severe weather so telling people to walk and ride bikes is only good in the summer!
492,1,0,[],"Have driverless cars available for instant calls.

The cars would be driving around until someone requests it or parked in a parking lot until called."
493,1,0,[],Have futuristic moving chairs that are installed onto side walks throughout the city. This will  enable people to just sit down and get to where they want to go!
494,1,0,[],"Have horse drawn carriages on Friday nights, this would be romantic and reduce pollution."
495,1,0,[],Have motorcycle drivers go around the city picking up passengers. It would be fun for the passengers and cause less pollution.
496,1,0,[],"Have old school buses converted into Eco friendly vehicles, then have them purchases by large local companies and drive to neighborhoods to pick up workers."
497,1,0,[],have school buses equiped with gps so you can track and not have the kids wait out in the cold.
498,1,0,[],"Have scooters that people can rent, this would reduce pollution and traffic."
499,1,0,[],"have soft landing missles ""shoot"" passengers from the suburbs to the city and back"
500,1,0,[],"Have the streets be less wide, in order to have small row gardens on the sides on the sidewalks. This interactive, edible walkway would promote and provide sidewalk snacks and usability. Easy fresh pick veggetables and fruits, less flooding and more city beauty!"
501,1,0,[],Having a neighborhood run community bus system. It would be exclusively a bus for people in the neighborhood to travel short distances.
502,1,0,[],having an on call drunk bus service
503,1,0,[],Having cars that drive themselves come and pick you up and take you where you need to go
504,1,0,[],"Having charter buses pick you up from designated spots around the city and dropping you off in various locations around, such as the mall, groceries etc."
505,1,0,[],"Having some sort of electric train that runs underground, just like the subway system in New York. The city that I currently live in doesn't have that option so having some sort of underground transportation system that runs all around the city constantly would make commuting much better for everyone."
506,1,0,[],Helicopter based taxi that can be taken anywhere.  The roof tops will now be loading and unloading areas and it will free up car congestion.
507,1,0,[],"Helicopter on demand. This would cater to the richer people in society. Instead of hailing a cab, you use your smart phone to summon a helicopter that lands near your home. You get inside and it takes you to your destination, must faster than a car could."
508,1,0,[],helicopter rides when lots of traffic
509,1,0,[],"Help public transit bring people to holiday events,fairs, festivals and sporting events in my community. Be sure to  with my local public transit system"
510,1,0,[],High speed rail
511,1,0,[],High speed rail train
512,1,0,[],"High speed trains to commute into Chicago from various cities throughout northwest Indiana, with sleek train stations that include lots of amenities (coffee shops, dry cleaning, etc.)"
513,1,0,[],"Hire young, strong people to peddle multi-passenger bicycles"
514,1,0,[],Horse and buggy.  A horse and buggy that picks up people and take them on rides in the neighborhood.
515,1,0,[],Horse and carriage.  Have someone make scheduled stops using a horse and carriage to pick people up and take them around the neighborhood.
516,1,0,[],horse drawn carriage I think it would be cool to do this again in our main downtown area where are the restaurants are. Would be nice.
517,1,0,[],Horse drawn carriage would rock here in this southwestern mountain town. People would really love it and it would be more reasonable for my area than just your average bus or taxi.
518,1,0,[],hot and ready to eat homemade cookie delivery
519,1,0,[],Hot ba's in bikini's pick you up. Guaranteed 7 on a scale of 1-10
520,1,0,[],Hot DUDES pick you up. Guaranteed Big Dad quality. Perfect for KOOL chicks and/or gay men and college students
521,1,0,[],Hover board that actually floats by air
522,1,0,[],Hover boards would be a great way for people to get from place to place while not using gas. They can charge it the night before and have it last all day without fail. Monthly cleaning will be needed. Not only would it save from using gas it will be the most popular form of transportation out there.
523,1,0,[],hover crafts that you could rent for the day
524,1,0,[],Hover-cars. Would operate without tire to road friction. Would need to be computer controlled. Could take advantage of current infrastructure for route guidance.
525,1,0,[],"Hoverboard rental. You order, somebody brings one to your house, and you can use it as a low-emissions (and fun!) way to run nearby errands. And if it catches on fire, it's not yours anyway!"
526,1,0,[],"hoverboard system

skateboard-only

electric only vehicles, or vehicles only powered by electricity"
527,1,0,[],Hoverboard.  The use of the hoverboards to get around.
528,1,0,[],"Hoverboard/Segway share: have stations located around the neighborhood where a hoverboard or a segway can be left to charge and then someone else can use it, leaving it at another station for someone else to use."
529,1,0,[],Hoverboards for everyone - once the technology is figured out that is.
530,1,0,[],Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.
531,1,0,[],"How about a deluxe line of buses. You have to pay 150 or above a month for a pass, but these run better routes, and they actually run on time. The regular monthly bus pass is 65, but the service is terrible. On this new route, absolutely no discounts, no half fares, no free rides. Always have security on the bus to get rid of the riff raff. This new deluxe bus wouldn't even share stops with the regular bus route."
532,1,0,[],"How about a rent-a-Segway system?  Kind of like Zipcars or the bicycle rentals in big cities - you could pick up a Segway at a docking station in one part of town and then drop it off at one in another part of town.  You would probably need some sort of point of sale system for a deposit on the Segway, but otherwise the city could price it however they wanted."
533,1,0,[],"How about an Uber motorcycle. I know a lot of people that have never ridden on a motorcycle, this gives them a chance to enjoy it."
534,1,0,[],"How about color coded cars that only service a particular area for a flat rate. As the car takes a passenger to desired location within that particular area, if another person flags that same colored car, that person can hop in and share the ride. After all, the drop off points will be in the same general area and the rate is flat."
535,1,0,[],"Huge people can carry smaller people ""piggy back"" style to their destinations.  My town is small so it wouldn't be very long."
536,1,0,[],Human sized drones. Highspeed rail like Japan has.Self driveable cars with an uber type interface. (cab drivers r terrible people)
537,1,0,[],Human Tubes where people slide through interconnected tubes throughout the city in order to bypass traffic.
538,1,0,[],Hydrogenase would be an aerial ship for a future low on oil. Itâ€™s a hybrid airship that would be entirely reliant on biofuels for transport and that could function as a vessel for a variety of reasons.
539,1,0,[],Hydrogenase would be an aerial ship for a future low on oil. Itâ€™s a hybrid airship that would be entirely reliant on biofuels for transport and that could function as a vessel for a variety of reasons.
540,1,0,[],Hydrogenase would be an aerial ship for a future low on oil. Itâ€™s a hybrid airship that would be entirely reliant on biofuels for transport and that could function as a vessel for a variety of reasons.
541,1,0,[],"hyper-bullet trains

solar-powered buses"
542,1,0,[],Hyperloop install in the city with individual cars that will rapidly take to any point in the city within seconds.
543,1,0,[],Hyperloop system that connects various California cities through ultra-fast tunnels
544,1,0,[],Hyperloop:  essentially a super fast subway in a pressurized tube like they use at the drive up to a bank to send things back and forth only on a scale large enough for people to ride in
545,1,0,[],"I also think there can be drones that can transport people flying at low altitudes way below planes so as not to disrupt plane systems. They can be coordinated in a central place to that there are no crashes, and the drones can be as autonomous as possible to avoid human error."
546,1,0,[],I always thought they should incorporate moving sidewalks into the city. Just like the airport. This would allow people to scoot around faster without putting more people on the road.
547,1,0,[],"I am deaf. That is why I would like to see closed captioning to announcements made to deaf, or a special light shown when there was a mechanical breakdown, and we could not hear the announcement to transfer to another bus."
548,1,0,[],"I am from Cincinnati, and one new mode of transportation that would be great here is a subway system. Tunnels already exist from a failed project decades ago, but with the growth the city has seen, it could be a viable option."
549,1,0,[],"I am thinking about a flying transport system. It should fly with balloon or air system. It should not need engine or fuel. So expence would be cheap. It should occupy 15-25 people at a time. It moves with air adjustment, drag, thrust, pressure etc. The flyer lands every important point in a city. So people can travel across the city with less time and money. No traffic block, signals, air pollution etc."
550,1,0,[],I am thinking of something like a city bus system but for uber. Rather than having to go from stop to stop and hope people are there the bus system can be smarter and go to the most packed stops or to those who have been waiting the longest based upon when they clicked the app. It would be much more efficient.
551,1,0,[],"I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
552,1,0,[],I believe a good future transportation system for my city would be a highspeed lightrail that can get people to their stop quickly and completely safely
553,1,0,[],I believe mobile sidewalks are a good idea. They could be on a conveyor system similar to escalators but on a flat plane and a bigger scale.
554,1,0,[],I believe my neighborhood should have some sort of electronic trolley system.  I can take multiple people throughout the day and network workers to certain destinations and landmarks.
555,1,0,[],I believe that we should have personalized rail system fro our neighborhood. The whole nei8ghborhhod should have a few of them available to different destinations. When someone wants to go there they hit a button and it sends it to them.
556,1,0,[],"I can imagine a speedbus being a new form of transportation.  It can have its own lane or tracks, and go as fast or faster than a train."
557,1,0,[],I can imagine an self-driving car company with a lot of cars. You would use an app on your phone like Uber. The car would automatically leave the lot and come pick you up.
558,1,0,[],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
559,1,0,[],I can see a series of tubes where people can step out of their house and dial in a destination and be delivered there instantaneous.  All travel will be tracked via a smartphone or implanted device.
560,1,0,[],I can see a transport type system where someone steps on a pad and it transport them digitally over to where they want to go within a town. kinda like the thing they had in willy wonkas chocolate factory but without the death ray pointer thing it would be just a pad like a dance dance revolution pad.
561,1,0,[],I can use the battery bike to avoid the air pollution in my home town
562,1,0,[],"I could imagine single rider tram cars. The cars would be tethered to cables above the streets. Something akin to ski lift carriage, but completely enclosed in glass. Advantage would be thy could run off electric current and would reduce ground street traffic"
563,1,0,[],I could see a trolley style system that ran on solar panels so that there would be no wires hanging.
564,1,0,[],"I don't anticipate the transportation system changing too much in my area no matter the time frame. I think the car will rule for the next several decades, but I would like the cars to change. They need not be so huge, and would be powered by plug-in type electrical engines. Each home would have a solar array and this would power your home, and your car. A back-up natural gas power plant would help out if it's cloudy for weeks. Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
565,1,0,[],I doubt I would take a bus but having them as an option would help some people
566,1,0,[],"I envision a new transportation system where we use old school busses to transport people to work.  The busses should be turned into green vehicles electric, hybrid or the like."
567,1,0,[],"I feel like there could be a uber shuttle, sort of like a train system."
568,1,0,[],"I feel that in the future there will be futuristic cars that will slowly evolve away from gasoline use more natural resources for fuel.  I think that the cars will continue to evolve into more sustainable, aerodynamic shapes and designs."
569,1,0,[],I feel the best is a transportation tunnel.  It should run around 150 miles per hour and provide food accommodations as well as sleeping areas!
570,1,0,[],"I get out of my house and before I leave my apartment on my 12th floor I just press a button on my app on my phone to type a location of the place i need to go.This would in turn contact all local data base systems of GPS based transport systems irrespective of the vendors available or government supported transport systems which include Cabs,Buses,Trains,Subway,3 Wheelers and most importantly assuming the people of the future will care a lot more about the environment and all the people who are going alone in a 5 seater car would have a option of sharing there carbon footprint left by the vehicle.And if the co-ordinates of the person with the car and the co-ordinates of the Person who is using the app matches then a Random Unique (one time use)Number or Picture or Anything which would be visible from atleast 10 feet away on a Min 6 inch screen.However this interface can be avoided by tracking the dots on the GPS system or by sending a snap shot of the car number or a photo of the person himself which will be destroyed automatically by the system once the person is down from the Vehicle.Punch Line Before I get to the main gates of the apartment.I should have the list of Vehicles available to me and the time it would take the vehicle to reach my place based on GPS and traffic conditions and also how much time would it take to reach my destination again based on real time traffic conditions and also most importantly.if i take  the public transport system.How much time would it take to reach the same destination and also how much Carbon foot print would i save from doing it.And also the time required by the vehicle to reach the local transport systems if it is not a walkable distance.There are many more ,But i think that is enough for the day.

GIVE THE CUSTOMER ALL THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS OF COMMUTING WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE COST AND THE TIME INVOLVED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VENDOR OR GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS..."
571,1,0,[],I have an idea of using only one big bus for our entire residence association
572,1,0,[],"I have no problem visualizing a new mode of transportation in my neighborhood. Years ago coal trains ran behind my house and the old gully is still there where the tracks were. Would love to see them back again, but it will never happen."
573,1,0,[],"I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
574,1,0,[],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
575,1,0,[],I hope to see people in flying vehicles in my neighborhood in the future. I would also like to see more amphibious vehicles.
576,1,0,[],I imagine a hot air balloon attached to cables that direct it at a low altitude to various stops. people get can out on platforms that they bring you to the ground with elevators.
577,1,0,[],"I imagine a kind of moving walkway in the sky.  The moving walkway would be built on stilts above the ground. An individual can hop on the moving walkway and can walk to another part of the city, but at a faster rate than normal walking. This would encourage taking our own two feet as transportation."
578,1,0,[],"I imagine a loop in my city where anyone would be able to have a short walk to the 'main artery' and be able to get anywhere at a major point within minutes; perhaps this would be a rail suspended above the city, or otherwise away from other major traffic; it would really help in efficiency of moving people around."
579,1,0,[],I imagine a magnetic public hovercraft system that goes to individual homes on a grid.
580,1,0,[],I imagine a railway system that goes through my town and all around the united states. It would be a bullet train like they have in europe that hovers and goes fast. It would be affordable too.
581,1,0,[],"I imagine a series of widening arches or loops of roadway and of several different sizes to accompany different types of pubic transport. Cars wouldn't be allowed in the city but stored at various exit point garages which would be provided by the city. Small roads would have small shuttles, large roads would have large fast moving shuttles that span the city. Independently, smaller walkways would be used for pedestrians and cyclists (and other man powered or tiny engine machines.) Larger walkways could become festival street fair type roads that are common in places like Greece."
582,1,0,[],I imagine a taxi speed boat that could take you downtown in a matter of minutes. It will help skip all the traffic on the street and cut your time in half. Perfect for people who live by bodies of water and are in a rush like NYC.
583,1,0,[],"I imagine a train line that rings the entire city, with interstitial lines to service the downtown areas."
584,1,0,[],"I imagine a train system that runs parallel to the street but is separated from it, unlike a streetcar. It could be elevated from the terrain when necessary to cross over obstacles."
585,1,0,[],I imagine a transportation system in which we all use underground super chutes. They move us from place to place within our town super fast. It would have to be set up so everything is safe of course. I imagine a network of these chutes spreading throughout the city and they pop you up wherever you want to go. Wouldn't that be amazing?
586,1,0,[],I imagine a type of highway for bicycles where people can use on and off ramps easily to reach their destination. They wont have to worry about cars since its a bike only highway system. it will get people to their destination quicker since they dont have to stop at traffic lights and watch out for pedestrians.
587,1,0,[],I imagine a type of hybrid car/rail system that are not owned by individuals.  A person would schedule a pickup to go to work and one home.  The cars would keep circulating picking up and dropping off people all day.  There would be much lesser need for personal parking as well.
588,1,0,[],I imagine a way to ride a school bus to various spots on its route. You would be pre-screened as an adult who could act as a school bus monitor and at the same time gain transportation to a location near the school. It would solve the problem of kids riding unsupervised and give another public transportation option in the neighborhood.
589,1,0,[],"I imagine an electric trolley like those old school ones, but it would be a hybrid system instead and people could hang off the back and ride it. There would be electronic pass cards that everyone could swipe on and off and it would be subsidized so anyone could use it for super cheap."
590,1,0,[],"I imagine hover bikes in the future, powered by solar energy."
591,1,0,[],I imagine people using hoverboards and personal flying vehicles for transportation in the future. Personal helicopters specifically and hoverboards similar to the ones in back to the future.
592,1,0,[],I imagine that instead of transporting with cars we could turn all the roads in our neighborhood into rivers and use boats to get to places.
593,1,0,[],"I live in a chicago suburb and I believe that driverless cars are the future.  But what I actually prefer is everyone driving their own vehicle, what i actually hope happens in the future is that licenses are much harder to get...there are so many people out there with no clue of the rules of the road and it is hazardous to everyone around them."
594,1,0,[],"I live in a fairly small town that has a decent amount of people but isn't very large in area. Solar powered railcars could be a viable option for this area. They would only have to travel short distances at once, and it could easily be utilized by everybody in town by having just a few stops. Think about the railcars in San Francisco and other major cities being completely solar powered. The electricity saving would be huge."
595,1,0,[],"I live in a neighborhood near an excellent metro system, but not walkable to it. I would like a people-mover sort of system that travels through the neighborhood making the existing metro station more accessible. Perhaps small cars or pods at the end of each street that travel along an elevated rail directly to the metro station."
596,1,0,[],"I live in a pretty population dense area where most things people need (like a hospital, a big job center, homes, grocery store) are pretty close to each other.  I think this set up begs for a monorail.  It would be elevated so wouldn't interfere with current traffic too much, but would provide a nice transportation system for people to take for short trips."
597,1,0,[],"I live in a rural area and a lot of people have horses- so an uber or lyft but actually with horses! If you are a nw rider, you can be on a horse on a lead rope, and if you have experience, you can just rent the horse!"
598,1,0,[],"I live in a rural area so horseback travel, hay wagon travel and buckboard travel may well be decent substitutes for cars and buses presently being used."
599,1,0,[],"I live in a rural area, it's pretty hilly but it runs along the length of a valley. It would be really nice to have a walking/bike path that connects the residential neighborhood to the commercial district without having the bike/walk on the road. Although it's generally slow traffic, walking on the road is never exactly safe. Especially in the winter. To be able to network together the few towns in the valley too would be very nice."
600,1,0,[],I live in a rural community about 1 hour from a city. I would like to see this area build a light rail commuter line that could link these isolated communities and boost the economy. Many people out here do not even have cars.
601,1,0,[],"I live in a small desert city with a major traffic congestion issue. However, despite the grid layout of the town, there is a diagonal irrigation canal running from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. Currently it has some poorly maintained walking paths, but that's about the extent of its development. Now, in the desert, loss of irrigation water to evaporation under the glaring sun is an issue. I'd propose creating a covered walkway/bike path where solar panels provide protection to the water, as well as pedestrians and cyclists. We could even use that solar energy to create small electric scooter rental/charging booths. It would provide a shortcut - a green highway from one end of town to the other."
602,1,0,[],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town. I can see the current roads changing to smaller lanes made for electric vehicles while most of the transportation needs will be fulfilled with bike and walking paths and personal hoverboard type of transportation.
603,1,0,[],"I live in a small village.  Everything is close together, so it might be possible to have a bicycle share program.  Bicycles could be borrowed and then returned to the same place or a different place.  This would allow people to get around without using cars."
604,1,0,[],"I live in a snowy climate, so there are a lot of times that we can't drive our cars anywhere because of all the snow. So a snowmobile taxi might work."
605,1,0,[],"i live in a somewhat smaller town in rural virginia. everything is super accessible and easy to get to. our town is gold cart friendly. my idea would be a cab service, but with golf carts. it would be a super fun way to help people get from point A to point B. it would also encourage safer driving."
606,1,0,[],I live in a town right on the ocean and there are many canals here. I think a canoe taxi service would be really convenient and fun. It wouldn't get people to their desired locations super fast but it would allow people to travel leisurely and enjoy the scenery along the way. It would also be really healthy for the people driving the canoes and help them to stay fit.
607,1,0,[],"I live in a town with a lot of freight trains. A subway system would be nice because it would get us places faster (the town is large in size and spread out over several miles) and be able to bypass the trains, which stop constantly. The subway would run either over the existing trains or under them and run off of cards that were prepaid like the MTAs."
608,1,0,[],"I live in a very hilly neighborhood. I suggest a funicular! A funicular is a railway built on a steep hill with tram cars for transport. Put it on one of the hills in the center of the neighborhood. People would be only a short walk (less than 10 minutes), hop on the funicular and it could take them to the church, the school and the neighborhood business district. Bam. No more worrying about going up and down the crazy hills, especially in the winter. Booyah!"
609,1,0,[],"I live in a very rural area that doesn't get bus service because of low population. My idea would be a bus service that runs on the same premise as a taxi service... when someone in the area would need a ride, the bus would alter its route to pick up a passenger. That way, the remote area could be serviced by mass transit, yet wouldn't have to waste fuel or money driving to the remote area all of the time. These requests could be put in via phone, web portal, or e-mail."
610,1,0,[],I live in an area where horses are abundant. It would be a trip if everyone started using their horse instead of a car or motorcycle.
611,1,0,[],"I live in an area where there are a lot of senior citizens so driving can sometimes be scary, and I think this city would greatly benefit from public transportation. However, I think something that would benefit the environment would be the most helpful, so I think pushcarts would be a lot of fun, or even horse drawn carriages. Not only would these be better for the environment, but I think the older people would appreciate the old-fashioned nature of such public transport systems."
612,1,0,[],I live in las vegas and I think that the tram should go from the airport to the strip and all the way down to fremont street.
613,1,0,[],"I live in NYC. Travel is not too difficult, with the only real concern being the price of a subway ticket or a taxi ride. With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue. I believe that since the roads and the undergrounds are already full, the only real option is to expand transportation above ground, such as on rails between buildings. This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem."
614,1,0,[],I live in the suburbs so all the rail lines converge on the central city. It would be nice if there was a light rail system that linked the different major suburbs together. You could connect it to the lines going to the city and across the country.
615,1,0,[],"i live in twin falls idaho and we could use a bus line, i guess it isn't a new idea  but yeah this is a place where there is sharp economic divide and all the businesses are on the rich side of town, the original town or the poor side of town ""old town"" is roughly a mile from the main drag so buses would be great for people who cant afford cars and better for the environment in general"
616,1,0,[],"I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
617,1,0,[],"I live on an army base. There are hundreds of vehicles that just sit around and collect rust, and it would be wonderful if the military could find some way to rent these vehicles out to the public. This would create income for individual units and help add to their budget, as well as providing vehicles to civilians who need them and even potentially drawing in interested persons who would otherwise never have driven a military vehicle."
618,1,0,[],"I lived in Japan and really enjoyed their system of underground rail. I think most cities in the United States could benefit from such a system, which has the added benefit of cutting down on DUIs. There is no rail system in my town."
619,1,0,[],"I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city. Would take ten minutes max to board and 10-15 minutes to go downtown."
620,1,0,[],"I picture a brand new train system, going down the main street, with street cars going leading up to the main street.   I would love to see it being a high speed system, paying with your fingerprints.   It would be similar to a credit card."
621,1,0,[],I picture a streamlined 'box' like a cable car that is hanging from a line or track throughout the city. It would be shaped like a rectangle with smooth edges and very compact and sleak. It glides up to the booth where people may get on and each cable car 'box' can hold 6 people in 3 rows of 2 with a small walking aisle to the side.
622,1,0,[],"I propose a motorcyle service that goes and fetches small items on demand (diapers, over the counter medicines, dinner supplies). I think this would be very useful for senior citizens and families with young children or single people who dont feel well."
623,1,0,[],I propose a truly revolutionary idea.  Personal sky paths.  It is about time we had highways in the sky to combat our now crowded roadways.  Added safety measures would be put in place like mandatory parachutes for civilian travel.
624,1,0,[],I propose an idea that would rely on strong wire much like telephone wire that would be used to support a small train carriage like car or pod.  I see this as being better than a railway as it would be not as expensive to implement.
625,1,0,[],I see a solar powered trolley going around the neighborhood.
626,1,0,[],I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
627,1,0,[],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
628,1,0,[],"I see the potential for self-driving cars to replace taxi services. People would call an automated line, or perhaps interact with a site/app on their computers/phones, to schedule to be picked up by the service. Meanwhile, a network that keeps track of all self-driving cars in its region would figure out which car was closest or would have to deviate the least to pick up the passenger within 5-10 minutes of being hailed. These cars could be compartmentalized to hold four or six passengers without individuals having to worry about undesired contact with the other passengers. The cars could run on electricity and the network would consider battery life with regards to planning routes and destinations."
629,1,0,[],"I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
630,1,0,[],"I think a drone transport system that would carry people, good and other items would be a great service.  An even better idea is if was peer run, meaning run by people in your neighborhood, and all the profits would be split."
631,1,0,[],I think a form of public transportation could be an electric type of subway that runs on a non intrusive track layed into the pavment much like a train track. It could be shaped like a normal subway but on the roof space there would be solar panels to generate electricity needed to run. Any remaining power needed could be provided by the tracks.
632,1,0,[],"I think a good idea will be to use electric cycles instead of a bike or a car in metros. They not only help in decreasing pollution as well as motivating people towards physical exercises.



A proper network of e cycles and connected to a main frame can be seen as a new transportation system emerging. Moreover this can also be used as a public transportation system by constructing cycle stands where they can be charged and the cost of public transport can be paid in the machine."

635,1,0,[],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
636,1,0,[],"I think a great idea within my neighborhood would basically to have a moving sidewalk like you would find at an airport.  This would allow people to move about faster than maybe they would walking, so people wouldn't feel the need to get in the car to go down the block to the store."
637,1,0,[],"I think a method that would improve the transportation system would be to change how turn lanes are handled in America. Overseas, to turn left, you veer off to a lane on the right that comes to a stop so that you don't block traffic waiting to turn and then when it is clear, you drive across the street onto the road you were going to turn onto."
638,1,0,[],I think a monorail system or cable cars like you see on ski lifts would be quite useful. moving walkways enclosed in a plastic tunnel to protect from elements that would have heat or a/c depending on the season would be really cool as well.
639,1,0,[],I think a new transportation that utilizes a type of rail system on the sidewalks that people can easily easily walk throughout the neighborhood - similar to the moving walkways at airports.  Sort of like a conveyor belt for people.
640,1,0,[],"I think a private school bus would be a great idea. Maybe it could be the size of a SUV and fit maybe 4 to 6 kids in it comfortable. Some kids are not able to take a bus to school so parents have to take public transportation every morning to drop them off. It could be like a Uber school bus sort of, each SUV bus will have certain school on their route that they can drop kids off at."
641,1,0,[],I think a spiral starting from the center of the city going out to the edges of the city.  The spiral should be able to get all the areas if it's only 2-3 blocks wide.  It would have a dedicated lane so traffic wouldn't affect the bus and vice versa.  There would be a way to quickly have people enter and exit the bus and this would keep it on time.  Of course the bus is electric powered.
642,1,0,[],I think a trolley system would work really well here. I live in Fort Collins and the city is very centralized but the traffic is terrible - perfect for a trolley!
643,1,0,[],I think a van that picks people up when the driver knows that person needs a ride because it is dark or they don't have a vehicle would be nice. The van would be wide enough to hold at least twenty people. It would be low maintenance. It would get good gas mileage. It would be comfortable.
644,1,0,[],I think adding a rail system in my city would be a great idea. The only public transportation we have is buses and there are a lot of areas they don't even run to. So I think a rail system would do wonders in getting a lot of other people where they were going.
645,1,0,[],"I think an automatic bus, possibly on a rail system so the times would be more predictable and rigorous."
646,1,0,[],"I think automated cars that work like taxis would be great.  They would have short range ones and long ranges ones.  Also, larger ones that go on busy commute routes each day to and from work.  With them being automated everything would be faster and run more efficiently."
647,1,0,[],I think because my city isn't THAT big a place that takes us to all the the important parts is vital. You would think a bus would do that but not the ones in my city. It's just small stops.
648,1,0,[],"I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it. I don't think that vehicle ownership will be nearly as widespread as it is these days, as driverless cars will be far safer."
649,1,0,[],"I think for small towns like mine (20,000) we should have a cross between a trolley and a hoverboard. If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
650,1,0,[],"I think freelance carpooling would be a great idea. Vehicle owner can at any time turn themselves into a taxi service. The service can be run through a phone app, workers can set their own hours and rates. This would cut down on pollution, eliminate unnecessary vehicles on the road, and boost the economy overall."
651,1,0,[],"I think having a streetcar system would be amazing, it could be automated to accept fares, and would provide safe transportation for all."
652,1,0,[],"I think high-speed tube travel would be great in my city. The tubes could be a system of plastic or rubber tubes that were buried underground. There would be a lot of tube stations downtown, but they would branch off to the outer city and suburbs. These tubes would have pods in them that were propelled by high-pressured air. The pods could be designed to carry one or two people each, and would be shot through the tubes for quick travel to your destination."
653,1,0,[],I think if we had automatic cars that you could order from your smart phone when you wanted it.
654,1,0,[],I think it should be a tunnel that everyone gets in and you press a button to where you wanna go and it will take you there in a flash.
655,1,0,[],"I think it would be cool if there were kisoks you could rent bicycles from.  Maybe put a gps tracker inside of them so people didn't try to steal them, or give people back part of their deposit when they returned the bike to another kisok."
656,1,0,[],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
657,1,0,[],I think my neighborhood and the surrounding city could use some sort of collection of energy efficient trams that can network passengers along the old railways that are no longer in use.
658,1,0,[],I think my neighborhood could benefit from ride-sharing bikes. We live in a suburb of Boston but technically a City. Not the easiest to get around and a lot to do.
659,1,0,[],I think my neighborhood would benefit from one of those pedal bike bars for the downtown area. There is a lot of history and what better way to enjoy it than while sipping a nice drink and getting some exercise
660,1,0,[],"I think teleportation would be awesome. Wouldn't need cars anymore, save on oil and fumes in the environment. People would be happier because they wouldn't be stuck in traffic or have to drive hours to see long distance family members."
661,1,0,[],"I think that a cool new transportation system would be a bike that we all pedal. It would be a long bike, maybe 5-8 seats long on each side. It would start with one rider who will then ride to other people's houses to pick others up. They would get on the bike and start peddling to pick the next person up."
662,1,0,[],"I think that a new mod of transportation in my neighborhood would be a electric bike taxi system. It would be an electric bike pulling a carriage that hold up to 3 other people. The system will travel from people's houses to their work place, local shopping centers and local entertainment places."
663,1,0,[],"I think that a trolly system would work well in phoenix.  They would run frequently, be smaller than a bus and go into more neighborhoods."
664,1,0,[],I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.
665,1,0,[],I think that community cars that attribute to car pooling would be wonderful.
666,1,0,[],"I think that one cool idea is to have personal transportation that allows you to connect with other people in your area so you can rideshare and also carpool or get a ride when needed. Instead of using like Craigslist to ask for rideshare or ask if people are willing to pick  them up, you use an app. People can sign into this app and then say which direction they are going. Along the way you can request that person pick you up to get you from A to B...kind of like hitchhiking through a mobile app."
667,1,0,[],I think that public buses should have some type of bike rack on the back of the bus. Some people want to take their bikes with them somewhere but the place is to far to bike the whole way.  The can chain their bike to the bike rack and remove it when they get off the bus. Of course space would be limited to about 2-3 bikes.
668,1,0,[],"I think that some sort of charging commuter car should be parked in every neighborhood. People could coordinate commute times and use electric cars instead of gas, in exchange they pay $1 a day to drive the car per person."
669,1,0,[],I think that there could be a light rail system or electric buses. there is enough sunlight to make them 100% clean
670,1,0,[],I think that there should be a way to get bugs off a windshield without harming the paint job on a car.  It should be a spray while you are driving much like windshield wiper fluid
671,1,0,[],I think that there should be some way that all the christmas trees at the end of the season could be recycled into some sort of useful wood.
672,1,0,[],I think that we need a rail system for our city. Its a growing city with lost of bigger cities around it. A main rail system like a subway would make things much easier to get from place to place.
673,1,0,[],"I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
674,1,0,[],"I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
675,1,0,[],I think there should be bikes that you can easily rent. You can get them in the major shopping areas and drive them around town to get excercise as well as helping to use less gasoline.
676,1,0,[],"I think there should be free neighborhood circulators that stop at significant shopping centers, landmarks, or services, that run throughout the day. I think they should be brightly colored bus-like vehicles."
677,1,0,[],I think there should be personal pods that can ride on train lines and trolley tracks.  These can be bought or rented.  They can follow the train or trolley and then be parked.  It could alleviate a congested train at rush hour.
678,1,0,[],I think we could bring back the streetcar in queens where the subway has low coverage. The streetcar would connect to the subway system which would be entirely rebuilt to accommodate new clean stations with solar panels and zero carbon foot print. This would connect with commuter and regional trains that would operate on an hourly scale.
679,1,0,[],"I think we could have carpool vans that schedule drop offs for us in the city which could save gas and promote a green clean transportation system. Also, we could take turns as drivers, with GPS equipped and a convertible top for sunny days."
680,1,0,[],I think we need a greener alternative to the uber/lyft types of services. Perhaps an app that connects you to bike and rickshaw drivers. Like an uber or lyft for rickshaws. I took a cycle rickshaw after a music festival this summer and it was great. Took a while to get to the destination but it felt really cool to get a ride from a biker.
681,1,0,[],"I think we need to tap into the power of magnets.  We can use solar panels all through the roads, then use them to power magnets on the road.  The vehicles will have oppositely polarized magnets that will be controllable in the car.  I guess it will work like those trains that use magnets, but someone smart will figure out a way to control the magnets independently.  The car battery will power the magnet on the car, and can be shut off immediately once the power is cut in case of emergency."
682,1,0,[],"I think we should focus on making it easier for people to bike around the area. We need to widen sidewalks and/or have separate paths just for pedestrians and bikers. Oftentimes, the bike lanes are narrow or end abruptly."
683,1,0,[],"I think we should have a system like Uber set up here. Allow individuals to ""sign up"" to be drivers at the town and people can book rides via the net, text messaging, or by calling. I think this should be tax-exempt income because then the town has no issue with gas or any other expenses because it makes this more profitable to retired people or others who can't work. With the way free market works we would almost always have enough drivers!"
684,1,0,[],I think we should have more and cheaper car sharing.  And use electric cars.
685,1,0,[],"I think we should incentivize walking. Tax breaks for people who walk to/from work. Discounts offered by businesses if you walk to their store. Municipalities will save by not needing to pave/upkeep roads. Less impermeable surfaces mean less runoff to deal with, etc etc. Sometimes the best innovation is redeploying the simplest of technologies..."
686,1,0,[],I thinking of transportation that you can transport yourself through your mind.  It would be through dreams that are real.
687,1,0,[],"I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
688,1,0,[],I visualize a car ride sharing phone application in which people put in the destination that they want to go to and they can connect with people going that same direction for a ride.
689,1,0,[],"I want a large, underground series of tunnels that offer a combination of walking paths, bike paths, and people movers so that people can easily move around the city during winter. As this would have a large number of entrances and exists, it would be more flexible (and cheaper) than the subway."
690,1,0,[],"I want a monorail system to run above street level (may be 20 feet up or so).  I want it to connect the suburbs to downtown, and circle the city.  It would run on magnets so that it would be extremely quiet.  It would be extremely fast.  I want it to provide a bird's eye view for commuters.  It would be a very safe way to travel, crime and personal safety would not be an issue."
691,1,0,[],I want a way to fly by myself to where I want without having to control it
692,1,0,[],"I want an elevated railway that preserves nature, resists going down during snow and bad weather, and reaches all areas of my city. It would be public transportation and have low-cost monthly passes. It would also run on renewable, clean energy."
693,1,0,[],I want one of those teletransporter things that zaps you from one spot to the next
694,1,0,[],"I want to see the Chicagoland suburbs connected by a train. Most often if they are, it's because they're on the same line going to Chicago, but I'd like to see a system that moves between suburbs that aren't connected on the train line."
695,1,0,[],"I was thinking of underground tunnels that you could access from certain points -- not for a subway. Instead, you get in the tunnels and you have the option to take various tunnels to certain destinations using your preferred mode of transportation: razor scooter, roller-blades, running/walking. You can check out a scooter at an entrance, drop it off at your destination. that way you never have to bring it with you, the entrances would have them on hand. or you can just run/walk if you want and it would be out of the cold/hot/rain/snow/sun, etc..."
696,1,0,[],"I was thinking that since the city I live in has a decently sized river, to save money, be cost effective, and lower power/energy usage, we can ferry people and personnel to central districts of the city and my neighborhood. Maybe the ferries/boat could be turbine powered to be more energy efficient."
697,1,0,[],I wish my neighborhood had a giant conveyor belt for going to all the main places downtown.  It would help the older people as well be convenient.  It would have to be waterproof and covered.  It could run all along the one side of the main intersections without ever having to cross.
698,1,0,[],"I wish we could get treadmill bikes. I saw a quick video of one invented in the U.K. I think. You walk on it and that powers a motor so you can move quickly even if you are just walking. We have many runners and walkers in our city, but only on trails or parks. If you could use them on the streets to actually get places it would be wonderful. You would also have to add some sort of safe parking places so they don't get stolen as I'm not sure you can lock them up."
699,1,0,[],"I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
700,1,0,[],"I wish we had separate bicycle highways that were enclosed spaces, both heated and cooled for summer/winter. It would be a cheaper mode of transportation. There would be protection to prevent car vs bicycle accident, a major problem in our area. It would also be healthier and exercise for the day during a commute. I picture it being a rounded space that is clear so you can see your surroundings outside."
701,1,0,[],"I would create a bicycle rental system that was accessible to wheelchair. Pittsburgh created rental bicycles, but they left out disabled adults."
702,1,0,[],I would enjoy having a limousine service in the neighborhood. That would be a safe and comfortable mode of transportation.
703,1,0,[],i would enjoy seeing horses as a way of public transportation more often
704,1,0,[],I would go with a moped service.  There would just be mopeds position around town and you have to drop it off at your stop to check out.
705,1,0,[],I would have the Metro system extended further into Virginia to lessen the commute time.  I would also call for train stations that were more accessible and uses solar energy predominantly.
706,1,0,[],"I would imagine a combination of Uber and self-driving cars. I can imagine a world where I don't own a car. Instead, I click a button on an app on my phone, and an automated car shows up shortly after, taking me wherever I need to go."
707,1,0,[],I would imagine a monorail type of situation.  With frequent stops around the neighborhood so everyone was able to get on relatively near their home.  It would move quickly and make stops at the nearby schools and stores.
708,1,0,[],I would imagine a street car type system that would connect each neighborhood.
709,1,0,[],I would imagine an electric scooter or hoverboard rental system.  You could use them when going to and from a train station stop and to your final destination.  I imagine a rental system so that you could pick one up at a train or bus station to go your extra distance and return it when you return.  Renting would be a good option if you did not have your own with you or only use it with other public transportation. Bad weather is always an issue using these devices.
710,1,0,[],"I would l to see a system of transportation where the service would do home pickups,similar to a bus, only the stops would be made at your home regularly for a monthly or yearly fee."
711,1,0,[],"I would like a car that can maneuver around slow people and even change shape when theres little room to maneuver, so I can get to work on time!"
712,1,0,[],"I would like a city trolley. The trolley would travel around the city several times a day, taking and picking up residents from the major shopping areas. The trolley stops should be no more than two blocks from any neighborhood."
713,1,0,[],"I would like a free car sharing service.  So the city provides cars, but that can only be used if they are full, so that you have an incentive to carpool, and as long as you do, you get a free ride."
714,1,0,[],"I would like a golf cart system that could get the kids to school on the paths, kind of like a bus system but on a much smaller scale."
715,1,0,[],I would like a non-gas mode of transportation to be created for our area such as a horse drawn carriage where the horses are treated really well but they also go fast and get us where we need to go.
716,1,0,[],I would like a taxi like system that doesn't charge so high.
717,1,0,[],I would like a teleporting system that can instantly take you from place to place
718,1,0,[],"I would like an interchangeable form of light rail, in which the train would have several compartments that would be destined for multiple locations. That way you just get on the train, and the train goes to an interchange. At the interchange the compartments are separated (I imagine they are held together by magnets) and grouped together by location. Once all the compartments that are going to the same area are together, the train leaves. It would work like changing trains, except you wouldn't have to go outside."
719,1,0,[],"I would like for a train to be in my neighborhood.   IT would go right down the sides of our main streets.   There is a train currently, but you have to drive far to it.   There should be more trains, not just one or two."
720,1,0,[],I would like for there to be a trolley/tram system through main street in my town. Main street goes straight through Beaver Dam and Hartford and passes by all the important stores/stops.
721,1,0,[],I would like it if the area I lived in used a bike sharing system like I have seen in some other major cities like Portland and Minneapolis.
722,1,0,[],I would like our city to have a railway system like downtown Miami. Its computer operated and is over ground. This means it wont impact traffic at all. Its a fast and easy service and its going to make things easier for all.
723,1,0,[],"I would like some sort of conveyor belt system or moving walkway (possibly with seats) in my city. It seems like it would be really nice for people, since people walk a lot here. Also, if there was a way to sit while moving, people could get work done and other things, while taking a 'slow ride' down the street (slower than a train, etc, so people can get on/ off while it's moving)."
724,1,0,[],I would like there to be a fast speed rail such as in Japan or Germany. I picture it being accurate time-wise and capable of transporting people over great distances. I would prefer it to a bus situation.
725,1,0,[],"I would like to have a subterranean network of moving roller coaster type tracks that move people to any location in the city easily, and deliver them right to the door step of where they need to go. This could be done by having exit points from the underground network of tracks that bring you to specific address clusters."
726,1,0,[],"I would like to have small trams throughout the county, making it more convenient for people to travel from city to city without stopping"
727,1,0,[],I would like to imagine being able to create a app and that uses credit cards. and invent a motorcycle scooter that has a huge row of seats in the back and runs like a mini van and use it as a taxi service. for only the city that I live in and name it Go Scooter transportation.
728,1,0,[],I would like to see a  people mover like in Detroit or Miami.
729,1,0,[],"I would like to see a bicycle highway.  It would go the length of regular highways, but be for bikes and pedestrians.  It should be wide enough for fast moving road cyclist, it should have passing lanes, and little road crossings.  There should be frequent on and off ramps.  There should also be many large parking areas.  Ideally it would even lead to public transportation areas with ample bike parking."
730,1,0,[],I would like to see a cable car that runs across the city.  It would take people across the busy streets.  It would be convenient for office workers. It would cut down on traffic in the downtown area.
731,1,0,[],"I would like to see a commuter bus with complete wifi access, as well as office equipment available."
732,1,0,[],I would like to see a high speed train connect all the major cities in my state as well as the major cities bordering our state.  I envision this high speed train to have minimal stations.  This would eliminate the need for air travel and long road trips.
733,1,0,[],I would like to see a hover system that occupies the same route as roads and highways to bypass traffic.
734,1,0,[],I would like to see a modern underground railway system installed in my neighbourhood. It would be noiseless and very fast. The railway will connect all the neighbourhood together making it easier to move around. The train would be making stops every half hour  to pick up and drop passengers.
735,1,0,[],"I would like to see a People Mover connecting Trenton, Southgate, Taylor and Wyandotte. There seems to be a lot of people walking down streets such as Trenton and Eureka, and especially so in the winter. I can envision a rail system supported by local tax dollars very similar to the one to the north in Detroit. People around here are constantly complaining about weather conditions and global warming and I think my method could bring a lot of people together and solve a lot of the commuting problems around here. There are just so many cars and it seems there is an average of just 1.5 people per vehicle. It is rather said. I really would want to push toward the people mover rail systems."
736,1,0,[],"I would like to see a public transportation system, funded by the government and running non-stop.  Possibly employing people in an uber style privately owned vehicle service.  Or some car pool ideas."
737,1,0,[],"I would like to see a short-term car rental service with semi-autonomous driving. For example, if I needed to go to the airport and didn't want to leave my current car in a parking lot their I could rent a car that I could summon with a smartphone app. The car would be able autonomously drive directly to me or a location I choose through the app. After I was at the location of my choosing and no longer needed the car, I could then use the app to send the car away."
738,1,0,[],I would like to see a solar powered train system
739,1,0,[],"I would like to see a system built around ""people movers"" - similar to the ride that was once at Disneyland.  It would run underneath the ground - under the traffic.  Each car would hold one or two people with large reclining chairs and a docking station for your laptop so you can watch movies, play games or actually do work."
740,1,0,[],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
741,1,0,[],I would like to see a system that would be quicker for pickups and drop offs. This would mean vehicles similar to busses but smaller and more efficient.
742,1,0,[],"I would like to see a transportation system that can be used for professional reasons, or personal, but not both."
743,1,0,[],"I would like to see all self driving cars, driving at top speeds because human error and crashes have been removed from the equation. So everyone can get to their destination five, maybe ten times as fast, without a significant infrastructure overhaul."
744,1,0,[],"I would like to see an advanced transportation system that involved driverless cars.  The idea is the same as using a taxi but without a driver.  Like Uber, you would use your mobile device to order a car and control the experience.  The car shows up at your door, takes you to your destination and you are billed for the ride. It would save me thousands of dollars in the cost to own, maintain, insure and license my own personal car."
745,1,0,[],I would like to see an expanded light rail system with more of a neighborhood connection.  Right now our light rail pretty much just connects the Downtown core with the airport.
746,1,0,[],I would like to see jetpacks so people can go long distances in a short amount of time without relatively much traffic. The cost would hopefully be relatively cheap as well once they were mass produced.
747,1,0,[],"I would like to see lightrail or street cars inbny neighbor hood.   Something that was powered in part by alternative energy.  Solar panels on the stations, perhaps on top of the light rail cars."
748,1,0,[],"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
749,1,0,[],I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
750,1,0,[],"I would like to see public transportation on buses expanded in my area, with a dedicated area for bicycles to also be transported on the buses.  This would help a lot with traffic, and still allow people to get to their destinations quickly."
751,1,0,[],I would like to see rocket skates as a transportation method. They might need something to help people keep balance but they would be fun to use and practical for some peoples lifestyle.
752,1,0,[],I would love a rail system to be installed in our city going north/south along the coast.
753,1,0,[],"I would love for there to a more intergrated train system in my city (specifically my neighborhood.) I'd love to be able to hop on a train (or streetcar) and be able to transfer to a larger rail system that would take me to other cities, etc. Something like what european cities have."
754,1,0,[],I would love if my neighborhood had a rail system that worked from magnets and floated along the rail at high speeds.  I wish that the cars were individual and that I could get in and select from a list of destinations.  I would like my own car and to be able to bring my dogs with me.  It would be fast and smooth and work with minimal power.
755,1,0,[],"I would love individual Segway transporters that would go from the house to the transit station.  They would just fit one person and keep them dry.  Only about 1 mile but just far enough in the rain not to walk.  Once at the transit station, the train takes you directly every 5 minutes into the city."
756,1,0,[],"I would love it if the city made walking and riding a bike more user friendly. There are no areas that are safe for pedestrians or bikers. If there were a bike lane, more people could move independently and get to where they are going. Commuters using more than one mode of transportation would be able to get to their destinations more quickly and with greater safety."
757,1,0,[],I would love to see a light rail system in my community. I am thinking of above ground trains that would run to the various suburbs and take people to various local stops. These trains should run a regular schedule so people can use them to commute.
758,1,0,[],"I would love to see a social network for people that work for a certain business. This social network would allow you to find rides from other employees that live in your area. Every business would have an account at this website, and employees who want to pick up other employees can volunteer. Maybe a $5 fee per person each week to account for gas money, but it could be like it would tell you who lives within 10 miles from you that works where you do, and you can ride share or carpool with them. It would be almost like a social network where you can talk to other employees you don't know and then you can ride together or take turns driving."
759,1,0,[],"I would love to see an Uber type of program but for doctor appointments. Where the doctor's office has drivers who are willing to pick up patients and drop them back off at home. Maybe like 1 person driving in a city and just bringing the patients to the doctor so that people won't have to drive to the doctor, especially older people."
760,1,0,[],"I would love to see heated sidewalks, so that everyone can walk safely in downtown Pittsburgh safely."
761,1,0,[],I would love to see more light rail transit added to Pittsburgh to alleviate some of the traffic congestion under ground
762,1,0,[],"I would love to see Pittsburgh, PA use some of unused railroads for light rail service. Many of our existing routes were cut, unfortuantely."
763,1,0,[],"I would love to see some kind of computer-operated taxi service in my city. The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
764,1,0,[],I would love to see the use of self propelled equipment like hover boards and such used to help decrease emissions from cars. Highways and roads could be established just for such travelors. and we would also save money on gas
765,1,0,[],"I would really like to see separate lanes for scooters in my area.  A lot more people are commuting this way, and it would be good if it was a safer way to drive."
766,1,0,[],I would rent golf carts in the summer to the elderly without cars so they could shop.
767,1,0,[],I would say the biggest way to improve innovating is to have all new construction be made in regards to current public transporation hub and those that cnanot be require them to build a public transportation hub. So all new communities have bus access or train access.
768,1,0,[],"I would suggest public car rentals funded monthly, with constant access."
769,1,0,[],I would suggest that there would be bullet train/subway that would rely on solar power/cooking oil/grease. It would connect to all parts of the continent. It would be energy efficient.
770,1,0,[],I would think a fleet of hovercraft would be amazing.  They wouldnt damage roads like cars and would allow people to get around with a minimum usage of energy.
771,1,0,[],I wrote a screenplay about bullying and I'm going to have in turn into a comic book and a film.
772,1,0,[],"I'd like to see a subway that has assigned seating.  It'd be nice that you could preorder a seat on the subway for a nominal fee - that seat is yours 100% of the time.   You never have to worry about it being taken.  Other than that, it remains completely the same..just reserved seats."
773,1,0,[],"I'd like to see shuttle trams in my area. It's a small section based urban area that has about four different areas all residents will have to visit at some point in time. If we had a shuttle system that specifically transported people from a central point to the four primary destinations it would incredibly reduce the use of fossil fuels, traffic, and accidents in the area."
774,1,0,[],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
775,1,0,[],I'd like to see some sort of autonomous shared fleet of cars that are fueled in some sort of environmentally friendly way. Solar panels on the roof? Maybe bike pedaling inside if you want to exercise and provide a small amount of power? I feel like autonomous cars alone will save a ton of energy just by eliminating traffic jams. And cut down on wind resistance since you wouldn't need to keep the traditional design necessarily.
776,1,0,[],I'd like to see the combination of a food truck and a taxi. This way you could grab a fresh made bite to eat while on your way to the destination. There would be a seating area in the front and a small kitchen with a service window in the back. This bus could serve hot and cold sandwiches and maybe drinkable soup in cups with lids to prevent spills. Now all you have to do is hail a cab. Forget finding something to eat then looking for the cab. The food can be prepared for you onboard.
777,1,0,[],I'd like to see the railroad tracks by our house be repurposed as a walking and biking route for the neighborhood.  It would be really sweet if they could use that and carry the corridor all the way to the nearest town and shopping area.
778,1,0,[],"I'd like to see underground travel possible through out the city.   Some massive tunnels, where you would have to take side tunnels to exits, but there would be major arteries.  It would replace a lot of above ground roads."
779,1,0,[],"I'd like to see vehicles that will fly, take up little space on the ground, go up and down more like a helicopter so large parking runways are not needed. These cars would almost fly themselves and need little direction other than where they're going."
780,1,0,[],"I'd love a system that is like Uber but just for cheap, shared rides home from the train. It'd cost less than a buck for everyone and operate as a shuttle for people that live within 5 mins of the train."
781,1,0,[],I'd love for some sort of shuttle system that worked at late hours between major points in town
782,1,0,[],"I'd love to see a crowdsourced method of alternate transportation in my city, where people could request rides from others who happen to be in the area and going the direction you need to with a minimal cost. There are so many people who have cars and it would be a great option for people who don't have reliable access to one. It could use cell phone apps and perhaps even have a traditional component using telephone for people who are less technologically inclined. The biggest challenge would be safety/security, and I'm honestly not sure how to overcome that aspect. There could be specific stops, almost like bus stops, where people could gather and wait for rides, or schedule rides to pick them up at certain times."
783,1,0,[],"I'd love to see an all-electric option for carpooling at the school where I work. There are 5 families whose children/adults work or attend school at the same place, and we live on the same street. We are about 10 miles from school. We could all ride to school together, charge the vehicle while we are at school, and ride home together."
784,1,0,[],"I'd really like to see a little pod that you could get into.  It has a minor sedative so you can relax on your commute.  A bus or something of the sort would come by and pick up pods which are locked and only you can open.  You hang a sign or type in your wanted destination, and a bus that goes roughly to the area scoops you up.  



Upon getting to your destination, the bus drops you off at a stop, and the sedative wears off with an alarm to wake you up."
785,1,0,[],"I'd use apps and social media so I know the times of all transport.  If it's late, I don't want to hang out too long. An app would pick up my location and show the times of the buses or street car. I could set it to warn me too."
786,1,0,[],"I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
787,1,0,[],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
788,1,0,[],"Idea 1 . Semi conductor can be design in such a way that it can be RE-USED.

789,1,0,[],"If it's a neighboorhood idea, maybe a coordination of volunteers via an app for either ridesharing or being the driver for a day."
790,1,0,[],"If we could all just travel through human sized and safe pods that take us from place to place like the banks vacuum system that would probably be the fastest, safest way."
791,1,0,[],"If we could be so technologically advanced to create giant versions of the airport conveyor belts where humans are carried across, that would be my new method of transportation. Since people are mostly lazy and want something to do the work for them (hence the upcoming popularity of the hands-free segway), this would be perfect to eliminate at least a fourth of the traffic on the street from cars."
792,1,0,[],If we had taxis in our neighborhood had a rewards card program where you can earn free rides.
793,1,0,[],Im from Seattle and it is mostly built over the top of the old city that burned down. I would think that they'd be able to build subways here at least through the downtown area where they have underground tours of the city.

797,1,0,[],"Improve the bike lanes while simultaneously passing legislation to give huge tax breaks to people who ride bikes. More people will ride bikes, save more money, burn less fuel, and be more in shape."
798,1,0,[],In dense urban areas have a series of high tension wires between buildings. Have a  mechanized seat something like a zipline  that people would ride on. This would need a seatbelt or maybe an enclosed capsule for safety but the idea is making the seat as compact as possible .
799,1,0,[],"In many neighborhoods, stop signs are ignored. I believe switching to yield signs, where ideally suitable, is needed and adding 'bus stops' for local schools that do not hinder traffic."
800,1,0,[],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
801,1,0,[],"In my city, it is almost impossible to not having a car since the public transportation is not that good. However, car ownership can be quite expensive. Car sharing could reduce the cost of having a car, we can build a system that anyone can use a ""public"" car that can be shared after paying a certain fixed cost up-front and hourly/daily rate afterward."

803,1,0,[],In my neighborhood I think the best type of transportation system would be an elevated railway like a tram at disney world it would make commuting between neighboring cities far easier and the technology would make commutes more timely.
804,1,0,[],In my neighborhood it would be like a monorail system. Something that you could get on at one stop and take it to another are you would want to go. Connecting locations you would visit.
805,1,0,[],"In my neighborhood, any kind of public transportation would be innovative. Due to the apparent stigma of such, I would propose a lovely electric-run ""uber coach"" instead of the big ugly city bus.

808,1,0,[],"In my neighborhood, there's not a lot of space, so I'd have to go with covered bikes of some sort, or one of those neat bike trollys. That would be a neat way to get around and exercise."
809,1,0,[],In the city i live in there is no public transportation. If some rails or buses could be brought in it could help a lot of people here.
810,1,0,[],"In the downtown area, stations to rent bicycles or even mopeds. Maybe you could have a really cheap membership and present your card at the check out station. Then you would return it at another check out station. It would cut down on how much people use cars. The key would be having enough stations to actually get the bike or moped to make the idea viable."
811,1,0,[],"in the future i would like for there to be a bus that is run on peddles that way people are able to work out while getting to where they need to go and they can take breaks if they are too tired. however, they cant stop for too long. also this will decrease the amount of gas that is being used"
812,1,0,[],In the future we could develop a pod system that takes each person directly to the place they want to go.  A pod station could be set up and all you do is type the address of the location where you want to go and it takes you there in seconds.  This would require some infrastructure and technology to build.
813,1,0,[],In the future we invent highly integrated solar bike. Now a days some company was invented solar bike but there is not enough in the future.
814,1,0,[],"In the future, self driving cabs can be summoned via mobile phone, to pick up the driver and take them to a particular destination via a touchscreen or other similar interface located inside the vehicle.  Some difficulty may occur if the passenger is unsure of the address of his or her destination, but a trained attendant can be called to determine the location for the passenger."
815,1,0,[],"In the future, there will be electric powered vehicle system. There will be transportation centers with different sized vehicles for rent for a small fee. The vehicles will range in size from one person scooters to six person vehicles. They will be rented on an hourly basis."
816,1,0,[],"In the interest of reducing traffic and accidents, a new series of self-driving only roads and lanes are opened.  On these roads, ONLY self driving cars are authorized to drive, and on them there are no speed limits (not that the self-driving cars would be going that much faster than normal). Unfettered by the chaos of common roads and the limitations of human judgement, these exclusively self-driving vehicle areas allow the navigational AIs to coordinate for an optimally fast and efficient journey."

824,1,0,[],"Instead of paving trucks coming through the neighborhoods, laying down new asphalt, it would be soap trucks.  The streets would be lined with giant tarps, and people would slip and slide to their destinations on specially crafted slip and sliders.  They would look sort of like a canoe, but with a flat bottom.  I think underneath the tarp, there would be air pockets that sensed whenever an object passed over them.  Whenever an object passes over the air pockets, they rapidly self inflate, thereby pushing the slip and slide canoe further and faster."
825,1,0,[],instead of sidewalks they could have people movers
826,1,0,[],Instead of traveling people can log on to fully functional robots around the city. When they are done they log off so someone else can use them. They would be able to function just like a human body.
827,1,0,[],"Interactive bus schedule app. You pick the starting destination and ending point, plus leave time and it will tell you what time the bus comes to that point, what the ETA and travel schedule is. Also would give a total cost for the trip. I live in a neighboring county and the small bus hooks up with the city bus, but I have no idea what time the bus comes to the bus stop by my house, nor how I would transfer to the bus that takes me to work."
828,1,0,[],"invent solar bikes, cars,etc.,"

832,1,0,[],"It is not innovative in terms of the whole world, but would be very innovative in my community - bike shares. The area where I live is suburban, so difficult to get enough riders for frequent mass transit. And it's too spread out for just walking. Bike share stands, where subscribers had a code to access bikes from a bike locker, would allow people to commute from place to place (even just to nearby main bus routes) with relative ease."
833,1,0,[],"It is similar to the monorail at Wald Disney world. It goes all around the town and stops when people use an app and state they need a pickup. It can go to individual streets and addresses because it needs no rails, but can use multiple-line systems to navigate the town. It makes scheduled stops, but can also be called by the app. It is free, paid for by local and state taxes, and very clean and quick. People use it for a wide variety of uses, from nights on the town, to grocery shopping, to work commute. It is very safe, clean and fun."
834,1,0,[],IT SHOULD BE BICYCLE. BECAUSE IT DOESNOT CREATE POLLUTION AND OUR CHOLESTROL LEVEL TO BE NORMAL.
835,1,0,[],It will be a tube were you go into individually you basically lay down like you are going to sleep and it slings you across a fast network of tubes to you closest stop where then you just walk too it!
836,1,0,[],It would be a free system (every family in the neighborhood would have to contribute $300-$400 as a one time fee). Then the bus would run through the neighborhood every hour and take you to anywhere in the neighborhood that you need to go! You would be able to text the driver before hand of where you are going.
837,1,0,[],It would be a new school bus system that runs on renewable energy. No more gas would be needed to get the kids to school and back home. Making our city one more step greener and setting the bar high!
838,1,0,[],"It would be a railway but instead of a train, it has small, separate cars that only fit one individual for their own convenience and comfort. The car would be a tall, rectangular box shape with a seat, kind of like a car seat inside."
839,1,0,[],"It would be a super fast train system. It would be so fast that my husband could get to his job, which is ten miles away in 5 minutes. It would be super popular and efficient. Everyone from business people to house wifes would want to use it."
840,1,0,[],"It would be a very good idea to come up with some kind of effective carpooling system in my area. I live in a rural place, but there could be a central park-and-ride lot built along the major thoroughfare to make carpooling simpler. Perhaps an app could be developed to run the carpooling system so that everyone is on the same page."
841,1,0,[],It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
842,1,0,[],It would be an app that allows people to call in helicopters to their location. It would let them call a helicopter to where they live and be transported from there.
843,1,0,[],It would be an electric tram that would ride in the center turning lane of my neighborhood.  It would look like a two-car train that would seat around 40 people.  It would make frequent stops at major intersections and shopping centers in the neighborhood by pulling off to the side in the bike lane. It would have solar panels on the top to help off-set the electricity use.
844,1,0,[],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
845,1,0,[],"It would be better if the government will create a new transpo scheme wherein there will be a separate lane for buses, a separate late wherein it is closed for every other vehicle and there are stations for the customers just like in train/subway system, card system will be used in the stations estimated time of the next bus arrival shown on screen and it can also be checked through a mobile app"
846,1,0,[],It would be cool (although pretty difficult to actually create) to have a gondola lift public transportation system that had cars that could travel over the streets and take people places avoiding traffic! There'd be stops that had elevators and stairs to get up to them and basically they'd just be suspended a bit above the streets and you could travel nicely between them over all the traffic below.
847,1,0,[],It would be cool it we had a monorail type system throughout the neighborhood that does a simple circle and takes kids or adults from the neighboorhood into the town/school area.
848,1,0,[],It would be effective to create a bike club in my neighborhood.  We would choose at least 1 day a week to ride our bikes to work decreasing neighborhood traffic and air pollution.  This bike club would host meetings once a month and reward people who rode the most days to work that month incentivizing people to ride more often.
849,1,0,[],"It would be great for our city to offer more access to the rails.  We could use an updated rail system that would make traveling to our larger cities in the state faster, more available, and yet still affordable.  It could bring more people to live in our city if they could travel fast to the big city and help grow our town here.  Our town is terribly depressed and I think that having a high-speed train or just general more options to travel through it would bring a massive amount of revenue into the city."
850,1,0,[],It would be great if there was a scooter share like there is with bicycles. Something where you swipe your credit card and drop it off at any station thats convenient to you.
851,1,0,[],It would be great if we all had hoverboards and could get around like that!
852,1,0,[],"It would be great if we could improve the pubic transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road. I would like to see self driving buses as well as bus only lanes and self driving cars. No manually controlled cars would be allowed and because of this hopefully the roads will be safer because most accidents and caused by human error. We could have the speed limits increased as well because self driving cars can ""see"" a lot father ahead than humans."
853,1,0,[],"It would be great if we had raised, walkable paths all throughout my neighborhood. They would be similar to bridges, only not as high and not as wide, that way people could walk or run for exercise and not worry about being struck by vehicles."
854,1,0,[],"It would be great to have a bike share program in my neighborhood. Just have a couple bike lock stations and have the city get us a bunch of bikes, and just use the bikes as we need them and park then when we're done."
855,1,0,[],"It would be hard to have a viable system in my neighborhood, because this area is so scattered. I think the best idea would be a bikeshare; inexpensive access to bikes would be a great idea! The bigger issue would be making our area bike-friendly. That's the part the requires creativity. We could add extra lanes and then add over/underpasses at intersections to make bikes not just inexpensive, but even more time-effective than driving."
856,1,0,[],It would be like a super fast tram or train so the people in my neighborhood could get to run errands without their cars. We could have stops at the entrances to the neighborhood and the tracks could just run down the street.
857,1,0,[],"it would be neat to have a cab/uber like service for kids, to bring them to school on demand."
858,1,0,[],"It would be nice to have a device that generates gentle waves in a pool. Similar to a water park ""wave pool"", but appropriate for small home pools."
859,1,0,[],"It would be small individual electric golf cart-like cars that run along the edge of the sidewalks every couple of minutes that people can hop into to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, post office, etc.  they operate from out of a common neighborhood ""hub"" so each system covers a small area.  People can just call one from an app on their smart phone, they are charged a small fee, then after the trip, the cart remains in one area until it is called again or it returns to the hub to be charged."
860,1,0,[],"It would be something like a tram. However, it would not need cables therefore not make the street appear uglier. People would be able to jump on it anywhere on the street. That was people could ride it wherever they want not having to get off at specific stops."

863,1,0,[],"It would replace everything: roads, sideways, buses, etc. It would be electric powered. Definitely automated. You should be able to transport to wherever you want to go without lifting a finger. Since it would replace sidewalks, you can simple stand on it and it would move you from one place to another, like a conveyor belt. It would be financed by monthly subscription, with VIP access for a higher price you can travel on the road with automatic cars that would operate in similar fashion."
864,1,0,[],"it'd be cool to have a rent a shop throughout the city for people who aren't able to afford bicycles or scooters, or any other sort of transportations. the can rent an item, and return it at the other part of town."
865,1,0,[],"It's a local version of Uber or Lyft, where you can download an app to get rides near you."
866,1,0,[],It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.
867,1,0,[],It's an elevated covered roadway somewhat similar to elevated train tracks but it's for bicycles and it has a bunch of fans to provide an artificial tailwind to provide a speed comparable to cars in a congested urban setting.

955,1,0,[],"My idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood is a series of really big tubes, with padding, and occasionally air holes, with mesh filters to prevent bugs and large debris from getting in.  The tubes would be places alongside all the streets, and be at a constant forward vacuum, with enough lessening of suction to allow people to grasp a handle at their stop and get out.   (If you miss your stop, you just ride around until it comes up again, pushing yourself towards the right tube as it comes towards you.)



Collision between travelers would need to be solved, as well as how to clean up any errant body fluids left by travelers; perhaps a daily purge at midnight, where the suction could be increased exponentially and all materials dumped in a pile, on a rotating schedule, on different people's lawns.   



This system has the benefit of a very low carbon footprint, and lends itself well to spontaneous exclamations of 'cowabunga'.  



Implementation note: This idea may require anti-gravity research, in addition to a lot of suction."
956,1,0,[],"My idea for public transportation would include an underground rail system powered by magnets. Because of the varied climate as well as prevalence natural disasters in my area, having the system underground seems like the best idea. The train would stop a lot more often than normal trains; At the end of every street at least. It would have a separate exit system in order to not lose quite as much time loading and unloading passengers."

959,1,0,[],My idea is a bicycle that has a solar panel covered frame so that when you are riding it the energy that comes into the solar panels is stored in a battery that you can use to power your phones or other electronics. The battery is also easily transportable so that you can take it with you into your office/home to power other electronics inside as well.
960,1,0,[],My idea is a car application that notifies you when you get in about the weather and road conditions.
961,1,0,[],"My idea is a combination of self driving cars, rideshare and a train. Commuters would pay for a ticket and a line of connected self driving cars would take commuters going the same route/direction to a certain dropoff point, like a train does. Then when the string of cars reaches the stop point, each passenger can enter their desired destination into the touchpad screen in the car and they would be driven to their individual destinations. The self driving cars would break off individually from the train to take these passengers, then they'd return on their own to the ""train station"" to go pick up more passengers."

966,1,0,[],My idea is having double decker buses to accommodate more people in public transportation.
967,1,0,[],"My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

970,1,0,[],My idea is to build an app for uber drivers that show all the short cuts to a location. Even if they have to drive through residential areas. The app will calculate the shortest distance and time depending on traffic.
971,1,0,[],My idea is to have a service like zipcar in which someone rents the use of a car by paying a monthly fee except that it would be mopeds for individuals or something larger like a pick up truck.  Just more options than a small smart car.  I used to live in Tokyo and driving a car there was awful but not something like a moped or motorcycle because they could ride in between the cars.  A larger vehicle like a pickup truck would be good for people who need to rent something to haul furniture or something like that but don't want to drive all the way to a car rental place or Lowe's to get the truck.  Everything would be rentable using an app and the cars would feature opening the doors and starting the cars through the app itself.
972,1,0,[],My idea is to have shoes that you can wear at the beach.  It would have a filter to sift the sand out.
973,1,0,[],My idea is to use special parking lots for energy efficient vehicles in order to give incentive to the use of cleaner energy. These parking lots could be in the more crowded city areas and you'd need a special pass or something after having your vehicle cleared.
974,1,0,[],"My idea would be a people mover, basically like a combination of a elevator and a train. It would be a box people stand in and it glides on a track really quickly. They would look like long boxes and hang from long lines that steer it and provide power. Their main concern would be to get many people somewhere extremely fast and efficiently, not really for comfort."
975,1,0,[],My Idea would be to make the alleyways in my city a lot more bike friendly.  Honestly they are very rarely ever used by the city or homeowners so to make them this way would be beneficial for so many others. This would I believe encourage more people to use bicycles since I know I am terrified when riding my bicycle next to extremely lage and fast moving automobile traffic on my cities roads and highways.
976,1,0,[],"My idea would be to use a moving belt (like used in airport terminals) instead of sidewalks to get around my neighborhood. I live is a small town (population about 500), so it would encourage people to drive less to get to destinations that are close to their homes."
977,1,0,[],"My mode of alternative transportation would include cars, buses, and trams running on solar energy in roadways. I'm unsure how it would work exactly, but if we could harness the power of the sun and build vehicles that have the panels either on them or in the tires it could remove the use of fossil fuels."
978,1,0,[],"My mom had this silly idea the other day when we were sitting in traffic. Cars that change shape depending on however many people were in it. Say, two people? It'd transform into a smartcar size. One person? Tiny one-person cubicle machine. Sure, it's not really feasible - but it's interesting. It'd make traffic feel less terrible if we could see how many people are in said car and how fast they'd be crossing streets and so on. Maybe have a designated lane for however many people?"
979,1,0,[],"My neighborhood added an above ground train similar to the ""L"" in Chicago.  It runs along the highways bringing people downtown from the suburbs.  It does a few loops downtown and runs near the major companies to get people to work.  It is much cheaper and more convenient than driving downtown and parking."
980,1,0,[],"My neighborhood currently has no bike lanes, so I would imagine a system with renewable transportation integrated into the layout. Spaces for bikes, electric car re-charging stations, etc."
981,1,0,[],"My neighborhood filled with uber drives. However, there is no cost assoicated with the transit it is all provided by the town. It would be like new york city (think of cabs), however nice black cars everywhere and someone can hop in to any one they want free of charge. Baisically be like public transit with uber and they will take you wherever you want."
982,1,0,[],"my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops. People will be able to travel to any part of the world without going through airports and flight connections. There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
983,1,0,[],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
984,1,0,[],My neighborhood has no transportation system. So a simple bus would help.
985,1,0,[],"My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
986,1,0,[],My neighborhood needs a car share system between individuals. It would be similar to Uber but you would be able to drive someone else's car for a monthly fee.
987,1,0,[],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
988,1,0,[],"My neighborhood/city/state is ultra conservative- so having bike lanes would be an improvement. Even though this city I live in (Huntsville, AL) has more Ph.D's per capita we are still woefully behind. Since it's such a tech town with so many engineers though...it would have to be something very advanced to get these engineers on board. Like some sort of train driven by magnetic rails."
989,1,0,[],My new transportation system would be a golf cart system. We have many elderly people who would enjoy being able to get around using golf carts. It would be a wa around the city without having to use the highway.
990,1,0,[],"My town is in desparate need of a form of public transportation. Everyone is reliant on a car or scooter. I think they don't have enough need to  warrant a bus route, but I'm in favor of widening the tiny bicycle lanes they have."
991,1,0,[],My transportation idea would be using technology to make car sharing more accessible. Such as a phone application. It would be cheaper than using lyft or uber.
992,1,0,[],"My transportation suggestion (in my town) would be to avoid the freeways and allow me to get to work using a rail way-type system.  This would be either underground or overground.  This is not an something that we see on the west coast a lot, so it would be very helpful to many commuters in the town I live."
993,1,0,[],"My transportation system would be for people to enter their own personal, flying car. The destination would be put into the onboard computer. And then the flying car would automatically proceed on the matrix."

998,1,0,[],"Not just in my neighborhood but metro-wide, my city recently established time share bicycles people can rent and ride when they have a short distance to travel. The bikes are all of the same design, having a large sturdy frame painted light blue, three gears (the gear box is inside the rear wheel axle, and LED blinker lights for safety. Necessarily, it's a one-size-fits-all arrangement; there's no way to raise or lower the seat unless you carry your own tools around with you, so if you're a tall person and use one of these bikes you'll be knocking yourself in the chin with your knees."
999,1,0,[],Now Houston already have public bike stations. These stations allow someone to check out a bike for the day for a small fee. In some other cities someone has the choice to rent a car for the day using a credit card . The cars are eco friendly and cost very little to rent. I'm not talking about CarMax. This service is similar to the same service that is offered to rent bikes here in Houston. I think Houston should think about bringing the idea to the city .

This would also be great for the environment."
1004,1,0,[],"One Idea I've always had was sky trams. It would operate just like your traditional tram system but instead of a point A to point B ride. You would have an additional 5 to 10 stops on a linear path, to support the stops I would use a magnetic rail system, instead of the old wire cable system. This would cut down on over crowding in terms of public and private transportation."

New paths could be created because they take up less space than normal roads and even designated lanes on existing roads could be defined to use existing infrastructure.  The environment would be healthier with less pollutants, crowding would be less due to smaller size vehicles, and it would even encourage healthier lifestyles out in the air and sunshine."
1013,1,0,[],"Our small city is fairly bike/walker friendly, but I think a bike rental kiosk or a bike trading program would be so helpful. I don't own a bike, but I'd like for it to be easier and quicker to get around without driving."
1014,1,0,[],"Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."

1149,1,0,[],"Some sort of free bicycle rides.  It would work by having you use a credit card (so people cannot steal bicycles) as a deposit.   Here's how it would work.  You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.

1183,1,0,[],"The city could do a partial co pay or cheap taxi or destination bus service. as in you meet the bus at a specific pick up place but then you tell the address you want, no designated stop."
1184,1,0,[],"The city has recently built a set of rollerblade kiosks that allow people to rent skates in their size.  By putting in their cash or credit card, they can rent them to go visit other locations and get a small refund when they return them to another kiosk."
1185,1,0,[],"The current highway infa structure in this country is outdated and in disrepair. We should reinvest in our bridges and highways and retrofit them with sensors to aid in the development of autonomous vehicles. Thus reducing gridlock, emissions, accidents, and travel times."
1186,1,0,[],The employer would work on a system to have every employee's address and map it.  Then a very large carpool could be created to make it easy for everyone to get there on time and save them money.  The employer could also provide the bus or van to make it even better.
1187,1,0,[],"The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
1188,1,0,[],The future of transportation in my city is by having self-automated driverless cars. They would reduce the amount of traffic congestion and reduce the number of car accidents.
1189,1,0,[],"The future of transportation is advancing rapidly but we still can't figure out how to end the fatalities that come with driving, but now with virtual reality gaming in effect they have finally announced a new app and means of transportation that allows you to have the ability to travel without even leaving your home. All you do is download the app, put on the goggles, enter the destination and you will travel to any location just like that. No, no, what you are thinking is time traveling, that's crazy, time traveling does not exist, what this is, is just a portal built to take you to your location without having to worry about the outside world. Don't worry it will be available for everyone so don't worry about it costing you an arm and a leg, well a few have lost arms but that was just the early testings."
1190,1,0,[],"The future transport system would be something which would be very unique, we may see air-car and air-bikes in future with different lanes distributed for them. These would fly at a very low altitude and would achieve very quick speed."
1191,1,0,[],"The future transportation system in me neighborhood is going to consist of driverless vehicles that hover and travel with the help of magnetism. The vehicles have built in solar panels that operate throughout the city 24/7. These vehicles all have routines they follow everyday so people just have to transfer according to where they want to go. On the other hand, if people want to own their own vehicle then it is possible. They can travel where ever they want to and all they have to do is to recharge their solar battery in the sunlight."
1192,1,0,[],"The future transportation system in my neighborhood is called air cars. They were created in an effort to reduce carbon footprints and try to save our planet. These vehicles are much more lighter than regular cars and can be upgraded to fly. The best thing about these cars is that they operate solely on air. What is even better is that there is a filter that intakes air and cleans it by trapping dirty air in a compartment only able to be removed by manufacturers. This is our last ditch effort to save the Earth, so buy a Clean Car."
1193,1,0,[],The future transportation system in my neighborhood would possibly incorporate traffic light systems that would detect the amount of traffic and flow to better keep traffic moving and prevent long lines and wait times at intersections therefor reducing trip times and automobile emissions.
1194,1,0,[],The idea is that free long term parking is offered at multiple nodes throughout the outskirts of the city. Within the city there are three primary modes of transport: public bicycles (if needed) for short distances between bus stops for medium distances and at key points throughout the city train stations for the longest stretches for cross city travel.
1195,1,0,[],The idea of having only driverless cars. No one will own a car. You just send a message through a driverless car app. The car closest to you will come pick you up. The cars will also have the ability to carpool (picking up people going in the same direction). The cars should also have the ability to go to a gas station on their own.
1196,1,0,[],The last new type of teleportation that I can think of would be tubes that connected to certain places and people could get in them to be pushed through to the other end of the tube to another area. They would be large and everywhere so it would only take up space in the air and there would be lots of places to go to.
1197,1,0,[],"The man used his old, used car for transportation every day to drive to work and back to his house."
1198,1,0,[],"The mode of transportation that I would imagine would be no different than an average city street. However, with the right conductors placed under the street the friction created by people's feet as they walked would supply supplemental power to the city. As such a person could get a ""walker"" designation that they could either receive some incentive for (pay or reduced taxes). This would get people more active and save the governemtn money and reduce environmental damage (through the waste of resources and nuclear power)."
1199,1,0,[],"The neighborhood I live in has alley ways behind our properties. So when getting kids to school in our town, we could have some sort of trolley or train-like vehicle that could go up and down the alleys picking up the kids. This would be quick and efficient and the kids would want to go to school because it would be fun and exciting."
1200,1,0,[],The neighborhood needs a rail system that runs adjacent to the highway. This would go from major city to major city with the same stops as for those that drive.
1201,1,0,[],"The new transportation in my neighborhood is by teleportation! There will be a number of discs on the floor, coated in white paint, that people will step on and be teleported to wherever they would like to be. There is a catch - you have to do jumping jacks to get the teleporter started!"
1202,1,0,[],"The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
1203,1,0,[],The second new type of teleportation that I can think of is a flying car. It would either have wings or a hover pad on it. It would be able to go to landing zones and be able to go to places faster than what is normally possible.
1204,1,0,[],The sidewalks could all be movable.
1205,1,0,[],"the sidewalks should move, and there should be bicycle lanes that move as well so that you can move on the double via the moving roads' motion and the bicycles' motion"
1206,1,0,[],"The suburbs are not currently served by the bus system. I believe that each suburb should get its own bus, which will take riders to a bus stop in the city. There, they may catch another bus or walk to their destination."
1207,1,0,[],The subway station can be replaced with magnetic levitation train. The subway train use electrically charged magnets to lift and move above the rail tracks.
1208,1,0,[],The system will be based off cable cars.  It's cheaper and easier to put up than bridges or building tunnels.  They will have their own traffic free paths.  The paths can even intersect by having the cables much higher than the other line's.  There can be platforms every so often so people can get on and off but not too many as to keep cost and commute time down.
1209,1,0,[],The technologies used in moving data among transport involve many different compontents and methodologies
1210,1,0,[],The terrain where I live can make public transportation hard to develop. It is very hilly. There is a main highway/route that runs straight enough that a rail system could work. It would be good to get people to the more populated section that could then hook up easily with other modes of public transportation (which do not exist right now but it could be done). It would not be high speed as there would need to be several stops along the way. It could be done with an electric source that would not be harmful for pollution.
1211,1,0,[],"The transport  tech-related industry very  used  in Technologies.

 the middle people transport Public Busses and Railway/ Trains/ Subways is used in Technologies"
1212,1,0,[],"The transportation system in my neighborhood consists of each person driving their own cars. Occasionally, people will carpool, but there is no public transportation and walking is not feasable."
1213,1,0,[],"The transportation system is much into the future where you get into a cylinder and press your destination on the buttons, somewhat like an elevator. The tube launches and within minutes, you arrive at your destination within the city limits. The cylinder, if you can imagine, is one like what you put your deposits in at a bank window."
1214,1,0,[],The transportation system would be a combination of roads with cars and a railroad track. All of the cars would be connected and be able to drive themselves. Cars would all be on tracks and controlled by the car itself. This would lower accidents and allow for better traffic. Cars would be able to accelerate much faster as there is no driver intervention and you don't have to wait for other cars to accelerate or worry about where other cars are going.
1215,1,0,[],"The transportation system would be like the sidewalks that move in the airport, you would just stand on the sidewalk and it would move you where you need to go."
1216,1,0,[],"The transportation would be efficient; it would be green and rely on newer energies that are not dependent upon fossil fuels. It also would be future-proof, such that it would reduce and combat the issues of traffic jams and collisions. We still would have private and public transportation, allowing people to make the choice of which is better for their needs. There also would be strict requirements for those who choose to drive; thus reducing the amount of likely collisions. It would be affordable and allow society to continue to grow and prosper."
1217,1,0,[],The van cars can be used as a means of transport for dropping people at scheduled times just like buses. They will have limited stops to minimize wait time and people using cars for nearby locations can use it instead of using cars personally or waiting for bus at bus stops which go stopping at all the bus stops.
1218,1,0,[],The vehicle run in the solar power.
1219,1,0,[],There are a lot of fairly narrow paths in between buildings in my area. It would be good if they could be paved smoother to be used by bicyclists. It would make their travel more efficient and would also increase their safety as they wouldn't have to spend as much time on roads meant for cars.
1220,1,0,[],There are a series of tubes that go over the city. The people get in and it acts like a pneumatic tube that sucks them to the next destination. It would be best for personal transport and no luggage would be allowed.
1221,1,0,[],"There are many back roads and residential routes around my neighborhood, so speed isn't as much of an issue to keep pace with traffic. I'd imagine a fleet of scooters that could be rented cheaply and easily could help residents get around town without much issue."
1222,1,0,[],"There are many parts of my area that aren't accessible by foot or bicycle; in order to get from one section of town to another, you have to take a highway, where only motorized vehicles area allowed. This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
1223,1,0,[],there are no trains in my city
1224,1,0,[],"There are solar powered buses in my neighborhood which are 100% sustainable and operate autonomously, very much like the commuter trams at some airports such as Miami International Airport. These require no labor, and as such, have no human element involved in decisionmaking. As they are programmed to stop at intervals (designated by where the bus stops would be) there is a set time to off-load and pick up customers. OF course, handicapped and large groups can press a certain button which would allow more time and/or ramps to deploy."
1225,1,0,[],There are two different modes of transportation within my city. The first one is a car. They usually have four doors on the left and right sides of them that open outwardly. There are four wheels and windows towards the top of the vehicle for viewing. The steering gear is located in the front seat on the left hand side and is controlled by the driver.
1226,1,0,[],There could be a really good motorcycle driver that would drive fast and come pick you up. He would know back roads and side allys very well. He could weve in and out of traffic and get you somewhere really fast.
1227,1,0,[],"There could be a train type of system but not using metal tracks like they have in europe (above ground?)  The trolley or bus could be made to target things people wanna go do instead of just transportation.  Like grocery shopping or night out to watch movie theatre and that way everyone is grouped and the businesses upsales, etc can develop better because of that."
1228,1,0,[],"There could be some kind of light rail system for the people.  It would make stops at malls, universities, grocery stores, and various event centers."
1229,1,0,[],"There has been a lot of talk around the country in the last several years about bullet trains.  I would like to see a dedicated train that funnels people downtown for work, no stops."
1230,1,0,[],There is no bus system so my idea is for a bus system in my area.  I live in a suburbs of a small town and there is no bus out here.  It would be nice to have one.  Sometimes I don't have access to a car and maybe this bus could help me get to the store or church.  I would also like the bus system to be able to take me to the small town to go shopping and stuff.
1231,1,0,[],"There is no public transportation in my neighborhood. We do not even have sidewalks for pedestrians. It is a major problem that I wish could be fixed, but no one cares about rural cities."
1232,1,0,[],There is no subway system here
1233,1,0,[],There needs to be a new system that picks you up at your place. A bus system that you can call to pick you up and the closest one will come. Kind of like a taxi but a bus so it can carry a lot more people.
1234,1,0,[],"There should be a completely separate bike lane that runs throughout the city, and is plowed even during the winter.  Currently the biking situation isn't too bad, but there are areas where it is hard to feel safe with cars passing by too closely.  During the winter, it is impossible to bike due to snow in the bike lanes"
1235,1,0,[],"There should be a free bus that runs from several locations (school, downtown, etc) to the train station on a loop all day and weekend. People would be able to hop on and off with ease."
1236,1,0,[],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
1237,1,0,[],There should be a roapway system by which local deliveries should be done by transporting items in tram and dropping them at specific points then the owner can arrange to collect his items.
1238,1,0,[],There should be a system where you can call for the bus to pick you up instead of it stopping at certain stops. It would go to the certain stops also but also pick you up if it has extra space in the time it has so it can save the Earth with carpooling.
1239,1,0,[],There should be a train system in our county. It should have a magnetic railway so it can be as green as possible and use light power.
1240,1,0,[],There should be government funding to give everyone bicycles.
1241,1,0,[],"There should be human powered roller coasters, where humans must provide energy to get it working."
1242,1,0,[],"There should be large carousel in the city that circles the block, so people just get on a horse and go where they can."
1243,1,0,[],"There should be paid service for a bus route to pick up people who live right outside a city. I will use my self as an example for my idea. I live about 20 miles for a major city . If I didn't have a automobile I would not be able to get anywhere important. Now the nearest cilty has a bus route only for those in the city. But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area. The school bus service already does this , I don't know why the city could come up with a plan to offer public transportation for adults living in rural areas. It's just very stupid that this is not a thing in Houston ."
1244,1,0,[],There should be tesla based uber.
1245,1,0,[],There was an idea to get a high speed rail in my town. It never happened but it would have been cool. It would have taken half an hour to get to a town 2 hours way. It would have been innovative! But the government shut down the idea. For what reason? Who knows.
1246,1,0,[],There will be a set of water slides that link the houses in my gated community.  They will have propelled sections that you control with a lever attached to your slide so you can visit neighbors without driving.  They will be enclosed for bad weather.
1247,1,0,[],There will be a system for elderly and handicapped people. They will pick up people from their houses and take them where they need to go.
1248,1,0,[],there will be driver-less cars and a lite rail system. There will still be some (free) bus transportation to fill in the gaps and help negate the need for new roads
1249,1,0,[],"There would be a four inch tall metal rail running between the sidewalk and curb, up and down every street. There would be small carts powered with gravity batteries that would run on the rails. This would help people stop relying on fossil fuel transportation"
1250,1,0,[],There would be a pay-to-use bicycle system similar to the Citi bicycles in New York City. It would allow people to exercise while getting to their location quickly. It would also relieve traffic congestion.
1251,1,0,[],"There would be a street train that would take people from downtown down the main road to the city limits. It would also connect to service to the next big city over. Bus service would be more frequent, and Uber would be allowed to begin service."
1252,1,0,[],There would be skateboard like devices that run on tracks that are embedded into the roads of the city. People could use a phone app to schedule for one of the boards to pick them up. The device would show up int he street outside of your house or wherever you currently are. You would hop on and you would put the address into the app of where you wanted to go.
1253,1,0,[],These are different methods of wheeled transportation modes.
1254,1,0,[],think it will be self driving cars aka taxis coming soon. really when apple says they are working on a self driving car
1255,1,0,[],This area could really use a super speed train that goes much faster than traffic. It could travel above the road system and would save tons of time for many people.
1256,1,0,[],This idea is about cable bus. Bus moving through cable in air. The cables are places all across the city in air. The bus moves across the cable without any traffic block. There will be stops.
1257,1,0,[],"This idea is aimed to put a copter' in your garage! Imagine instead of opening your garage to a car, instead theres a small personal helicopter inside.  These small, one or two person max flying vehicles would be ideal for keeping roadways clear!"
1258,1,0,[],"This idea is called 'Rolling taxi'. The system is a large ball. single large ball. Inside the ball, people can sit . People sit or stand at the centre of the ball. As ball rolls on specially made road the centre region doesn't move. The centre region where people sit is attached to the  inner surface of the ball in a special manner so that people do not move. The speed and direction of the ball can control using technology. The ball roll all across the city with people inside on a special track. Speed is high and expense is less. Also it is fun."
1259,1,0,[],This idea relies on a series of jitneys.  Jitneys going back and forth to pick up a few people along the way and also dropping people off.  No need for any tracks as they could use already existing roadways.
1260,1,0,[],This idea uses the sky!  A station or helipad is set up and an aircraft is used that utilizes wing and rotors. Basically a cheaper and a bit smaller helicopter.  This is ideal in my opinion as it is a vertical takeoff which takes far less space than a runway.
1261,1,0,[],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
1262,1,0,[],This is a hybrid airship. Technology has developed that allows these vehicles to be more compact and use hydrogen lift cells safely. There are dozens of air ferries lifting people quietly into the air and to major cities all across America. The carbon footprint of the consumer aviation industry is drastically reduced. The noise pollution of traditional airports is all but gone. The hybrid airship is the vehicle of choice in terms of transportation.
1263,1,0,[],"This is a transportation system that delivers food directly to people's houses. It exists in a large city and people will use an App on their phones to get food delivered to their house. They can enter the restaurant, find out what they want, and someone will deliver the food item by any mean they choose whether it be car or bicycle or walking. The app will also store people's favorite orders at their restaurants so they don't have to think about what to order."
1264,1,0,[],"This is about a single user system. It is similar to a bicycle. But it's does not run on road. It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable. We take it from home or rent from government."
1265,1,0,[],"This is about car pooling. As our residences are located far away from our work place, we, in our neighborhood have passed a resolution that to share our sitting in our cars (each a day in a week) to reduce pollution, save money, etc. and it works good too. :-)"
1266,1,0,[],"This is an that will assemble all associated interests and find matching interests, such as books and movie recommendations."
1267,1,0,[],"This is probably only suitable for thrillseekers, but I'd like to see some kind of zipline (with safety harnesses) from one tall structure to another. It might discourage things like base jumping, and it would be an extremely quick method of getting from one office to another."
1268,1,0,[],"This might be only useful for some places, but it's better than none.  I think there should be a moving walkway for the most common areas of a town or city.  This way foot traffic can be consistent and the flow high.  Since it's fairly low speed there shouldn't be any injury issues and transferring is as easy as getting off the one walkway and on to another."
1269,1,0,[],"This new transportation system is a bullet train in the sky, able to span around the neighborhood with up to 700 passengers in under two minutes. It's sleek silver coat is never late, and always early to make sure everyone gets where they need to go. The rails float there in the sky, ready to carry this majestic beauty to the ends of the neighborhood making sure everyone is early"
1270,1,0,[],"This personal transport would utilize a series of driverless cars.  In tandem with smartphone integration, you could get to where you need to go with the help of just an app!"
1271,1,0,[],"This system is like an invisible gondola ride, with individual pods that up to a party of 4 can get into, running on magnetic lines."
1272,1,0,[],"This system would be made up of a continuous stream of drivers of small vehicles.  The vehicles might be three-wheelers or some other form of small, motorized vehicles.  Besides the driver, the vehicles would only have space for two other occupants.  The vehicles would continue on the same busy stretch of road.  In other words, they would be on a fixed path.  Also, there would be a large number of these vehicles, a constant stream, so the passenger would never have to wait longer than a minute or two.  The passengers would have prepaid for the service, so there would be no need to exchange money with the driver."
1273,1,0,[],This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
1274,1,0,[],This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.
1275,1,0,[],Three wheels auto two in back and one in front. 4 to 5 people can travel in it.
1276,1,0,[],"Ticket sharing system for people who make infrequent trips into the city, or suddenly need to do several trips in a row. A group of people could collectively share a commuter pass for the train or bus system. It would be like a Netflix of commuter passes. The ticket could be held in an existing business or maybe a library, and the ticket would be checked out like a book. People would pay each day they hold the ticket."
1277,1,0,[],"To help cover a lot of area of a city, the could be a central hub where all the trains, busses, etc start.  Then from that one spot, all the route lines shoot out, like a star.  That way all the people can be at one spot and make it to where they want to go easily since there are no transfers or any other confusing things."
1278,1,0,[],To reduce gridlock and rush hour traffic governments should offer tax incentives for employers offering a staggered work day. I.e. Employees scheduled to be gin work at different times rather than the 7-10 o'clock  morning hour.

1286,1,0,[],"Transportation is mostly done by cars nowadays, but why don't we use rocket powered shoes instead? Flying with footwear is not only cool, it would be much faster than driving."
1287,1,0,[],Transportation that would allow people to rent out electric self driving cars. This would let people have cars pick them up at whatever location they want and have the car autonomously drive to their destination. Similar to a fleet of self driving electric taxis. This would greatly reduce the cost of transportation in my opinion because people would not have to buy cars but could rather rent or lease them.
1288,1,0,[],transportation vehicles
1289,1,0,[],"Transportation would not be about getting the general population from home to work and back. It would be about moving goods and services to people directly.

1300,1,0,[],"Uber is not currently available in my area, because it is not seen as a large enough ""metro"" area. I believe that if several of the small communities pooled together, there would be enough available and willing drivers to start a less urban and more suburban/rural version of a paid ridesharing service. Since the communities would be pooled, there would likely be drivers from many different areas of the community, so a larger geographic area could be served."

1304,1,0,[],"Uber pedicab for downtown service.  This service could be used downtown to help people who only have to go a short distance to get to their destination.  Pedicabs are fun and instead of them having to ride around looking for people to pick up, people could request them from a phone app."
1305,1,0,[],"Uber style delivery service. When someone needs something picked up (groceries, take out order, new TV, etc) they can use the Uber style app to let a driver know where and what needs picking up and where it needs to be delivered. This could be great for restaurants that don't deliver. If it's added as part of the Uber platform it could probably be cheaper than delivery fees from the places that deliver from restaurants"
1306,1,0,[],Uber-like service that has small personal celf-drive cars that are shared by the community. App interface to request a car and specify whether you are willing to share you car with a small number of other people

1367,1,0,[],We ought to revisit the trolley system because the buses in New York City are plagued by heavy traffic. We should have electric trolleys on main thoroughfares. It worked in the old days. Sometimes old ideas mixed with new technology is GENIUS!
1368,1,0,[],We plan for buy a battery car for our neighbor which help us for the transport. . It will help us to control the pollution for our environment .
1369,1,0,[],We should be giving people a tax deduction for doing more walking and/or bike riding to reduce transportation in vehicles.  This applies to my city because everything is so close!
1370,1,0,[],We should come up with a car service system that can be computer operated and you can have it just by dialing a number. It would be like a railway system but with cars.
1371,1,0,[],We should have an underground subway system. For a city as large as the one I live in it would make sense. It would be faster for everyone and clear the roads of buses that clog up traffic during rush hour.
1372,1,0,[],We want to use battery car in our neighborhood because it is has no smoke and also it will not affect the environment and will make us safe   .
1373,1,0,[],"We will have cars that can lift off the ground and ""fly"" with a air propel system. This would be fast enough for them to travel in that city area without hitting any others."
1374,1,0,[],"We would ride hovercraft to a monorail station. The monorail would take us to work, school, etc."
1375,1,0,[],What I'd really like to see is every sidewalk turned into one of those escalator-pully things like they have at the airports.  Just a moving track so you can relax.  Possibly with a few chairs scattered throughout it for people to sit down.
1376,1,0,[],"What if you have self-propelled vehicles (i.e., pedals like a bike) that provide protection against the elements (a roof made of canvass and plastic walls).  These could carry 4-6 people, and someone strong could volunteer to provide the pedal power each day."
1377,1,0,[],what is needed is a tubular powered zipline based transportation system. a combination of pnewumatic and electric power will propel people from place to place in a similar manner to a ski lift except it would just be a small tube that has a chain of sorts running in it along the sidewalks. all you would have to do is to have a harness on and when you need to go to one of the destinations you hook on to the line that is color coded for your destination and cruise on down there. Not the most comfortable way to travel but the infrastructure for a neighborhood would be relatively inexpensive.
1378,1,0,[],"What we need is a better public transportation system that services the East end of the city.  Perhaps a bullet shuttle that will pick up in certain areas of the East End, and shuttle t predetermined locations within the city such as the downtown area, in addition to other areas."
1379,1,0,[],When I imagine future transportation in my neighborhood I visualize the vehicles of today with more advanced technology. I image that the vehicles will be able to drive themselves and all that is needed is for a person to input their destination and sit back. I think that the interior of the vehicles will be the biggest changes because these vehicles will allow people to sit back and relax. I think that the interior will be comfortable seats and have TVs to pass the time. Overall I imagine future transportation being someone similar to today but with less demand on people.
1380,1,0,[],"When I traveled Asia they had trucks with benches in the back, they went around the same routes all and quickly picked up and dropped off people, similar to a bus but quicker and easier"
1381,1,0,[],a bus that plays all 80s music all the time
1382,1,0,[],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
1383,1,0,[],"A human carrying drone. This would require it to be build and withstand certain weight thresholds, such as up to 200 pounds. You would call a drone in and let it know where you want to go. It would pick you up and fly you there at a decent rate of speed and without having to sit in traffic."
1384,1,0,[],"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."
1385,1,0,[],"Car sharing. Everyone can join a club which has some monthly fee, let's say $100. If they pay this, then they find someone who lets them ride everyday with them to work and back home. They driver gets most of the money (the rest goes to overhead) and takes them to and from work everyday. So I guess it's like a taxi service with a monthly fee, hopefully that using people that work with you at your job."
1386,1,0,[],"Change the road into a high speed moving floor, like what they have at airport terminals but faster and with chairs to sit in.  You can board a chair in a parking lot/driveway and operate a machine to choose destination.  The chair will then merge into the moving road and go for the destination."
1387,1,0,[],Combining food delivery services with taxi driving to maximize efficiency.
1388,1,0,[],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
1389,1,0,[],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
1390,1,0,[],"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."

1404,2,361,['system'],"A Bus system, within the metro area that was funded by a tax on gas purchased by individual commuters. In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."
1405,2,361,['system'],A cab system which optimizes fares by calculating the best way to get multiple people to their destination. It's like a bus but it doesn't follow a route.
1406,2,361,['system'],"A car that woeks with the magnetic forces of earth, applying a system that can take advantage of all the force that can be generated.

The route in my small district of the city takes approximately 20 minutes to to circumnavigate and consists of goth commercial districts. One would never be more than 10 minutes fro being able to hail the ""jitney"" bus. This alleviates the use of regular bus system which is much more focused on funneling clientele to central city and runs more or less eradicately.It envisions using current tech and is human centered. It is innovative in it's goals not hardware."
1410,2,361,['system'],A community system that is managed electronically and requests cars any time of day. All cars are electric and will take you anywhere you want to go for a set charge and there are maintenance teams that come and clean cars during the day.

1417,2,361,['system'],"A human tube system, similar to televison shows like Futurama, and already in use by banks, albeit for parcels and not people. If we installed vacuum tubes that led to a multitude of central destinations, we could develop a toll system alongside it. Using air pressure would cut out emissions immensely, and would be relatively fast, allowing for faster travel times than traditional modes of transportation. However, the difficulty would come from utilizing the system in such a way that remained safe for all those involved, perhaps through making use of a stop and go turbine system, that worked similarly to a stop light. A smart air restriction system would allow for one way travel, and then a short delay, followed by travel in the other direction."
1418,2,361,['system'],"A human-sized slot-car system.  Where cars run independently self-driving down a track through electricity like a trolley car, but just big enough for a regular sized family (in other words size of a regular car).  In order to move faster cars can link up by matching speed and then essentially ""plugging"" into the car ahead of it.  This could go much faster than regular cars and not have any of the problems associated with regular self-drive cars seeing as they move on a track."

If just you are on your way to work, you hop in your single passenger pod, and take off!"
1422,2,361,['system'],"A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.

1431,2,361,['system'],A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
1432,2,361,['system'],"A new transportation system  can be something somewhat like a train, but a small train like shuttle, which can take others around the neighborhood, easy, fast and no traffic."
1433,2,361,['system'],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
1434,2,361,['system'],A new transportation system for our neighborhood could be shared scooters.  The scooters would be open for all to use and stocked at locations around the neighborhood.  You could check them out and return them for less money than the cost of a scooter.

The drones would fly like helicopters, but can  can also be controlled using a remote control. Unlike a car which can transport several passengers, the drone would be only be able to transport one person."
1436,2,361,['system'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
1437,2,361,['system'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
1438,2,361,['system'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be similar to a train line, just on a smaller scale. It would pick people up in a series of pods and deposit them at their place of work for a small fee. This new train type line could also be used in the same way that a bus is, to run errands. The new system would have comfortable couch like chairs and be far more acceptable than the current forms of trnasportation availabe."

1440,2,361,['system'],"A new transportation system would be a large electric powered bus. It would not run on gasoline but on electricity. It would pick people up from stops and drop them off for a fee. It would also go into smaller developments to pick people up like an Uber would, but more environmentally friendly."
1441,2,361,['system'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
1442,2,361,['system'],A new transportation system.... Self driving cars/ trolleys (absolutely no tracks or special lanes for the trolley just self driving)
1443,2,361,['system'],A new trolley system with free transportation would be beneficial since the neighborhood isn't very big and it would do well for people who could be handicap. I think the new trolley system could be hybrid -- electric and gas -- which most trolleys aren't.

1467,2,361,['system'],"A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
1468,2,361,['system'],"A subway system in my city is badly needed. We have terrible traffic and everything in the city is built in a grid system. It would save time, money and gas consumption for millions."
1469,2,361,['system'],A subway system where you sit in a seat that attaches to a rail as soon as you are seated. You are then transported to your destination. This removes the need to wait for trains like a regular subway.

1471,2,361,['system'],"A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."
1472,2,361,['system'],A system in which no one leaves their house ever. Everything they need is brought to them by drones. They never need to leave even for vacation because virtual reality is so realistic.

1479,2,361,['system'],"A system where there are rails above you and nothing underneath you.

You sit in a cart of sorts and you are guided along near the streets, maybe above the streets or sidewalk.

The beach is about an hour from our town (or three hours with summer traffic), and all traffic to the beach comes through our town due to an important bridge.  We could have a train that leaves from our town, or other stops nearby, and then expresses to the beach.  People would need extra room for luggage - or you could couple it with a luggage delivery system.  It would cut down on time to the beach and the number of cars on the road."
1483,2,361,['system'],A tram system that is operated by a robot where you can stop as you please and not at stations
1484,2,361,['system'],"A transportation system would include wide use of self-driving cars to facilitate efficiency and safety. Cars may be privately owned, or there may be a pay-as-you go or contract type system if you do not wish to own a vehicle. There would also be a total bike lane system for those who prefer to ride bicycles. The bike lanes would be much safer than what exists now."
1485,2,361,['system'],a trolley system that goes through the main line of town. hop on/hop off style so that people can use it to get to work
1486,2,361,['system'],"A trolley system would be a great source of transportation, using small trolleys instead of buses.  Another Idea would be a mini bus system that primarily transported people to key areas like the train station or the airport.  A shuttle system."
1487,2,361,['system'],"A trolley, or electric street car system."
1488,2,361,['system'],"A tube system, similar to how you can send packages through tubes in factories, get people in tubes. Futurama has a concept like this, but this could be somewhat realistic. It could go pretty far and be good for the environment. It would require a better infrastructure but it would make going long distances without public transportation a viable option. Unless you consider this public trans."
1489,2,361,['system'],A velodrome type system for bicycles.
1490,2,361,['system'],"A well established public transport system, like subway, will ease the transportation problem. It will save energy and make fewer cars on the road."
1491,2,361,['system'],A zip line system above the ground that brings people to schools and event locations. This would be a fun innovate way to get people from one location to another.
1492,2,361,['system'],Adding a light rail system to support the university and the surrounding apartments.
1493,2,361,['system'],"An above-ground train system. We scrapped a trolley system, and some areas can't support a subway. Above-ground might be useful for us."
1494,2,361,['system'],"An alternate transportation system in my neighborhood would be a free transportation system that can take you anywhere that you like. Paying for transportation is not easy since everybody carries debit or credit cards nowadays. Hardly anybody has change or cash on them. Free transportation would be great, and it should be something other than a bus. It should just be a regular vehicle as well with a friendly driver to take you somewhere."
1495,2,361,['system'],"An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
1496,2,361,['system'],"An automated car pickup system. You connect via an app on a computer, tablet, or cell phone and let the system know the time you need to leave; it then sends a size appropriate vehicle to your door to pick you up and on your way you go!"
1497,2,361,['system'],An automated monorail like system that goes through the entire community at a regular interval day and night.
1498,2,361,['system'],"An automated system of cabs. Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."
1499,2,361,['system'],"An elevated wagon wheel shaped, high speed rail system would be excellent. The outer ring would be bi-directional allowing quick transport around the city. The spokes would be bi-directional and allow quick transport from inner and outer within the quadrants."
1500,2,361,['system'],"An expansion of the skyrail or a similar system with connection to the skyrail could be added to the surrounding cities of Seattle. The addition of public transportation would cut pollution and reduce traffic congestion with the plus side of convenience. It would be a good idea to implement this idea while we still have space available, rather than wait until the problem is a burden."
1501,2,361,['system'],An idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood would be to use cars with automated driving that would allow the person(s) to input the destination and go about doing other things while the car drove itself to that location.
1502,2,361,['system'],An on demand bicycle system where a truck (with a trailer?) will bring a bicycle to your current location and then you can leave it in place when you're done. Reservations could be made in advance using an app.
1503,2,361,['system'],"An overhead puppy cart system, the same concept as in skii resorts. I live in NYC, and outside of traveling by train, there are no other practicals transportation which avoids traffic. Unlike the the train system, you would be able to make direct routes, with a bonus of great views around the city"
1504,2,361,['system'],An overhead rail system.
1505,2,361,['system'],An UBer like system where neighbors help neighbors on a rotating basis.
1506,2,361,['system'],"An uber-like system for public transit busses. Riders must request pick up 24 hours ahead of time, and the bus would come to their door or as close as it could to pick the rider up. The fare could be determined by how many riders requested pick up, and drop off to a central location (downtown). From there maybe there would be additional busses that go directly to drop off points rather than on a pre-set route."
1507,2,361,['system'],"An underground network system in the neighborhood, like a subway but only bikes and small motorcycles can travel through. This will be a good way to protect against the weather and steer clear of any incoming cars."
1508,2,361,['system'],An underground rail system would be great. That way you could get around without having to get stuck in traffic.  There are so many cars in this area that we are known for our traffic.
1509,2,361,['system'],"An underground Seqway track which will take a while to build but will be extremely beneficial. There are no turns as underground paths are completely straight. Recharger stations are at every mile or two. There are practically no intersections or traffic lights except at major hubs, which are few and far between. Delivery services such as mail and UPS are a major component of this transportation system, which will make them faster and clear up traffic on major roads."
1510,2,361,['system'],"An underground system in my small town like a subway. But instead of a subway underground, it would be those moving sidewalks you see in the airports that you could walk or glide quickly from place to place."
1511,2,361,['system'],"An underground tunnel system just for people, bikes and mopeds.  The idea is that all the cars and congestion can stay up above and people can safely walk or transport themselves around without worrying about cars and busses getting in the way or being run over by them.  Every so often there is a ramp that allows you to exit, as well as natural light through grates and proper ventilation.  It would also be a great way to get around when it snows."
1512,2,361,['system'],"Another idea for a new transportation system would be a magnetic bullet train system, similar to the one they have in Japan. It would be a national rail system built over the old railroads we have now. It would go to every major city in America and would take half the time to do so."
1513,2,361,['system'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
1514,2,361,['system'],"As a socially awkward recluse who doesn't drive, I want to be able to call an automated system for a driver-less taxi. I want the option to pay online via debit/credit, gift card or Paypal or have the option to insert bills into the car door before being able to enter. I'd like to be able to pick my music genres for the ride as well."
1515,2,361,['system'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
1516,2,361,['system'],"Automated bus lines that run to every street in America. Something similar to a trolley system, without the rails."
1517,2,361,['system'],Automated driverless car systems - eliminate car ownership and use a network of public self-driving cars to travel

1520,2,361,['system'],Bicycles with wheels like trains are placed on rails and whoever is going to the market takes this bsicycle and with little bit of paddling the bicycle can reach the destination. There should be distance system where two bicycles should be impossible to collide.
1521,2,361,['system'],"biking system, where people can rent bikes and use them and drop them off at other stations."
1522,2,361,['system'],"Chicago - Chicago has a great system and phenomenal public transport. As far as transportation though I wish the highways in the city acted like slotted cars, similar to trains in which in every highway entrance there would be a dedicated lane/railway for vehicles to travel at fast speeds like trains. This would reduce traffic and travel times."
1523,2,361,['system'],Create an underground rail system that allows people to travel to all major hubs of the city. This would save gas and ease pollution.
1524,2,361,['system'],"Currently, I live in a small town that has a public transportation system. However, you have to call and wait for the bus to pick you up, instead of waiting at a pre-determined stop, and it can take forever to get where you're going. I propose a busing system that's like the one in bigger cities for my neighborhood. People could still call and wait for a bus, but buses should also stop and pick people up at predetermined stops at regular intervals."
1525,2,361,['system'],"Currently, my city is very underserved by the public transportation system. I believe that the existing public transit should be expanded with a greater fleet of buses, so that all people in my community could be served. The buses currently in operation only reach about half (if that) of the city's occupants, leaving many without an opportunity to get where they need to go quickly and affordably."
1526,2,361,['system'],"Driverless cars, it's the only thing I can imagine being different in my neighborhood.  We do not have room for new rail systems."
1527,2,361,['system'],Each neighborhood gets together to say what time they will be leaving that has a automatic system that will call and tell everyone in the neighborhood or in short distance where they are going and when they are leaving.  That way they can catch a ride with others and not have to guess where or when they are leaving. It could be like a carpool system where everywhere you go it will auto call if that person is gong to another location and you still have room in your vehicle.
1528,2,361,['system'],Electric buses would be an amazing addition to my city but we would have to integrate a system of cables that the city may or may not support. San Francisco has the ones I mean.
1529,2,361,['system'],Electric camper style van. This would be completely powered by electricity and allow people to live in their vehicle. This would allow the electric system in the car to work synonymous with the electric system in the camper.
1530,2,361,['system'],Everything would be done through a smartphone app. It would be a transport system that gathers everyone together with common interests. It would be a way to make friends and get to your destination.
1531,2,361,['system'],Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
1532,2,361,['system'],"flying transportation system will be very famous in future for example flying car, flying scatter board bike and so"
1533,2,361,['system'],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
1534,2,361,['system'],Future transportation system in my neighborhood could be a electric bicycle taxi system where neighborhood resents can take shorts trips like the grocery store or sending kids off to school.
1535,2,361,['system'],Have a monorail system around town. It'll reduce pollution because people will have fun using it instead of driving their cars.
1536,2,361,['system'],Have a system of moving sidewalks that has chairs (with seatbelt for safety) mounted to it. People can just sit down and be transported quickly throughout the city.
1537,2,361,['system'],Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
1538,2,361,['system'],Have a system of skylift that can transport people within the city. This could really reduce traffic congestion. This network goes above the ground traffic and moves quickly.
1539,2,361,['system'],"Have a transportation system in the city where there is a tunneling system filled miniature train with small passenger capacity. These miniature trains can take people directly to their destination and the best part is that because they are small, there can be a large number of them running underneath the city."
1540,2,361,['system'],Having a neighborhood run community bus system. It would be exclusively a bus for people in the neighborhood to travel short distances.
1541,2,361,['system'],"Having some sort of electric train that runs underground, just like the subway system in New York. The city that I currently live in doesn't have that option so having some sort of underground transportation system that runs all around the city constantly would make commuting much better for everyone."
1542,2,361,['system'],"Help public transit bring people to holiday events,fairs, festivals and sporting events in my community. Be sure to  with my local public transit system"
1543,2,361,['system'],"hoverboard system

skateboard-only

electric only vehicles, or vehicles only powered by electricity"
1544,2,361,['system'],"How about a rent-a-Segway system?  Kind of like Zipcars or the bicycle rentals in big cities - you could pick up a Segway at a docking station in one part of town and then drop it off at one in another part of town.  You would probably need some sort of point of sale system for a deposit on the Segway, but otherwise the city could price it however they wanted."
1545,2,361,['system'],Hyperloop system that connects various California cities through ultra-fast tunnels
1546,2,361,['system'],"I also think there can be drones that can transport people flying at low altitudes way below planes so as not to disrupt plane systems. They can be coordinated in a central place to that there are no crashes, and the drones can be as autonomous as possible to avoid human error."
1547,2,361,['system'],"I am from Cincinnati, and one new mode of transportation that would be great here is a subway system. Tunnels already exist from a failed project decades ago, but with the growth the city has seen, it could be a viable option."
1548,2,361,['system'],"I am thinking about a flying transport system. It should fly with balloon or air system. It should not need engine or fuel. So expence would be cheap. It should occupy 15-25 people at a time. It moves with air adjustment, drag, thrust, pressure etc. The flyer lands every important point in a city. So people can travel across the city with less time and money. No traffic block, signals, air pollution etc."
1549,2,361,['system'],I am thinking of something like a city bus system but for uber. Rather than having to go from stop to stop and hope people are there the bus system can be smarter and go to the most packed stops or to those who have been waiting the longest based upon when they clicked the app. It would be much more efficient.
1550,2,361,['system'],"I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
1551,2,361,['system'],I believe a good future transportation system for my city would be a highspeed lightrail that can get people to their stop quickly and completely safely
1552,2,361,['system'],I believe mobile sidewalks are a good idea. They could be on a conveyor system similar to escalators but on a flat plane and a bigger scale.
1553,2,361,['system'],I believe my neighborhood should have some sort of electronic trolley system.  I can take multiple people throughout the day and network workers to certain destinations and landmarks.
1554,2,361,['system'],I believe that we should have personalized rail system fro our neighborhood. The whole nei8ghborhhod should have a few of them available to different destinations. When someone wants to go there they hit a button and it sends it to them.
1555,2,361,['system'],I can see a transport type system where someone steps on a pad and it transport them digitally over to where they want to go within a town. kinda like the thing they had in willy wonkas chocolate factory but without the death ray pointer thing it would be just a pad like a dance dance revolution pad.
1556,2,361,['system'],I could see a trolley style system that ran on solar panels so that there would be no wires hanging.
1557,2,361,['system'],"I don't anticipate the transportation system changing too much in my area no matter the time frame. I think the car will rule for the next several decades, but I would like the cars to change. They need not be so huge, and would be powered by plug-in type electrical engines. Each home would have a solar array and this would power your home, and your car. A back-up natural gas power plant would help out if it's cloudy for weeks. Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
1558,2,361,['system'],"I envision a new transportation system where we use old school busses to transport people to work.  The busses should be turned into green vehicles electric, hybrid or the like."
1559,2,361,['system'],"I feel like there could be a uber shuttle, sort of like a train system."
1560,2,361,['system'],"I get out of my house and before I leave my apartment on my 12th floor I just press a button on my app on my phone to type a location of the place i need to go.This would in turn contact all local data base systems of GPS based transport systems irrespective of the vendors available or government supported transport systems which include Cabs,Buses,Trains,Subway,3 Wheelers and most importantly assuming the people of the future will care a lot more about the environment and all the people who are going alone in a 5 seater car would have a option of sharing there carbon footprint left by the vehicle.And if the co-ordinates of the person with the car and the co-ordinates of the Person who is using the app matches then a Random Unique (one time use)Number or Picture or Anything which would be visible from atleast 10 feet away on a Min 6 inch screen.However this interface can be avoided by tracking the dots on the GPS system or by sending a snap shot of the car number or a photo of the person himself which will be destroyed automatically by the system once the person is down from the Vehicle.Punch Line Before I get to the main gates of the apartment.I should have the list of Vehicles available to me and the time it would take the vehicle to reach my place based on GPS and traffic conditions and also how much time would it take to reach my destination again based on real time traffic conditions and also most importantly.if i take  the public transport system.How much time would it take to reach the same destination and also how much Carbon foot print would i save from doing it.And also the time required by the vehicle to reach the local transport systems if it is not a walkable distance.There are many more ,But i think that is enough for the day.

GIVE THE CUSTOMER ALL THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS OF COMMUTING WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE COST AND THE TIME INVOLVED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VENDOR OR GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS..."
1561,2,361,['system'],"I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
1562,2,361,['system'],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
1563,2,361,['system'],I imagine a magnetic public hovercraft system that goes to individual homes on a grid.
1564,2,361,['system'],I imagine a railway system that goes through my town and all around the united states. It would be a bullet train like they have in europe that hovers and goes fast. It would be affordable too.
1565,2,361,['system'],"I imagine a train system that runs parallel to the street but is separated from it, unlike a streetcar. It could be elevated from the terrain when necessary to cross over obstacles."
1566,2,361,['system'],I imagine a transportation system in which we all use underground super chutes. They move us from place to place within our town super fast. It would have to be set up so everything is safe of course. I imagine a network of these chutes spreading throughout the city and they pop you up wherever you want to go. Wouldn't that be amazing?
1567,2,361,['system'],I imagine a type of highway for bicycles where people can use on and off ramps easily to reach their destination. They wont have to worry about cars since its a bike only highway system. it will get people to their destination quicker since they dont have to stop at traffic lights and watch out for pedestrians.
1568,2,361,['system'],I imagine a type of hybrid car/rail system that are not owned by individuals.  A person would schedule a pickup to go to work and one home.  The cars would keep circulating picking up and dropping off people all day.  There would be much lesser need for personal parking as well.
1569,2,361,['system'],"I imagine an electric trolley like those old school ones, but it would be a hybrid system instead and people could hang off the back and ride it. There would be electronic pass cards that everyone could swipe on and off and it would be subsidized so anyone could use it for super cheap."
1570,2,361,['system'],"I live in a neighborhood near an excellent metro system, but not walkable to it. I would like a people-mover sort of system that travels through the neighborhood making the existing metro station more accessible. Perhaps small cars or pods at the end of each street that travel along an elevated rail directly to the metro station."
1571,2,361,['system'],"I live in a pretty population dense area where most things people need (like a hospital, a big job center, homes, grocery store) are pretty close to each other.  I think this set up begs for a monorail.  It would be elevated so wouldn't interfere with current traffic too much, but would provide a nice transportation system for people to take for short trips."
1572,2,361,['system'],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town. I can see the current roads changing to smaller lanes made for electric vehicles while most of the transportation needs will be fulfilled with bike and walking paths and personal hoverboard type of transportation.
1573,2,361,['system'],"I live in a town with a lot of freight trains. A subway system would be nice because it would get us places faster (the town is large in size and spread out over several miles) and be able to bypass the trains, which stop constantly. The subway would run either over the existing trains or under them and run off of cards that were prepaid like the MTAs."
1574,2,361,['system'],"I live in an area where there are a lot of senior citizens so driving can sometimes be scary, and I think this city would greatly benefit from public transportation. However, I think something that would benefit the environment would be the most helpful, so I think pushcarts would be a lot of fun, or even horse drawn carriages. Not only would these be better for the environment, but I think the older people would appreciate the old-fashioned nature of such public transport systems."
1575,2,361,['system'],I live in the suburbs so all the rail lines converge on the central city. It would be nice if there was a light rail system that linked the different major suburbs together. You could connect it to the lines going to the city and across the country.
1576,2,361,['system'],"I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
1577,2,361,['system'],"I lived in Japan and really enjoyed their system of underground rail. I think most cities in the United States could benefit from such a system, which has the added benefit of cutting down on DUIs. There is no rail system in my town."
1578,2,361,['system'],"I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city. Would take ten minutes max to board and 10-15 minutes to go downtown."
1579,2,361,['system'],"I picture a brand new train system, going down the main street, with street cars going leading up to the main street.   I would love to see it being a high speed system, paying with your fingerprints.   It would be similar to a credit card."
1580,2,361,['system'],"I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
1581,2,361,['system'],"I think a drone transport system that would carry people, good and other items would be a great service.  An even better idea is if was peer run, meaning run by people in your neighborhood, and all the profits would be split."
1582,2,361,['system'],"I think a good idea will be to use electric cycles instead of a bike or a car in metros. They not only help in decreasing pollution as well as motivating people towards physical exercises.



A proper network of e cycles and connected to a main frame can be seen as a new transportation system emerging. Moreover this can also be used as a public transportation system by constructing cycle stands where they can be charged and the cost of public transport can be paid in the machine."

1585,2,361,['system'],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
1586,2,361,['system'],"I think a method that would improve the transportation system would be to change how turn lanes are handled in America. Overseas, to turn left, you veer off to a lane on the right that comes to a stop so that you don't block traffic waiting to turn and then when it is clear, you drive across the street onto the road you were going to turn onto."
1587,2,361,['system'],I think a monorail system or cable cars like you see on ski lifts would be quite useful. moving walkways enclosed in a plastic tunnel to protect from elements that would have heat or a/c depending on the season would be really cool as well.
1588,2,361,['system'],I think a new transportation that utilizes a type of rail system on the sidewalks that people can easily easily walk throughout the neighborhood - similar to the moving walkways at airports.  Sort of like a conveyor belt for people.
1589,2,361,['system'],I think a trolley system would work really well here. I live in Fort Collins and the city is very centralized but the traffic is terrible - perfect for a trolley!
1590,2,361,['system'],I think adding a rail system in my city would be a great idea. The only public transportation we have is buses and there are a lot of areas they don't even run to. So I think a rail system would do wonders in getting a lot of other people where they were going.
1591,2,361,['system'],"I think an automatic bus, possibly on a rail system so the times would be more predictable and rigorous."
1592,2,361,['system'],"I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it. I don't think that vehicle ownership will be nearly as widespread as it is these days, as driverless cars will be far safer."
1593,2,361,['system'],"I think for small towns like mine (20,000) we should have a cross between a trolley and a hoverboard. If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
1594,2,361,['system'],"I think having a streetcar system would be amazing, it could be automated to accept fares, and would provide safe transportation for all."
1595,2,361,['system'],"I think high-speed tube travel would be great in my city. The tubes could be a system of plastic or rubber tubes that were buried underground. There would be a lot of tube stations downtown, but they would branch off to the outer city and suburbs. These tubes would have pods in them that were propelled by high-pressured air. The pods could be designed to carry one or two people each, and would be shot through the tubes for quick travel to your destination."
1596,2,361,['system'],"I think that a cool new transportation system would be a bike that we all pedal. It would be a long bike, maybe 5-8 seats long on each side. It would start with one rider who will then ride to other people's houses to pick others up. They would get on the bike and start peddling to pick the next person up."
1597,2,361,['system'],"I think that a new mod of transportation in my neighborhood would be a electric bike taxi system. It would be an electric bike pulling a carriage that hold up to 3 other people. The system will travel from people's houses to their work place, local shopping centers and local entertainment places."
1598,2,361,['system'],"I think that a trolly system would work well in phoenix.  They would run frequently, be smaller than a bus and go into more neighborhoods."
1599,2,361,['system'],I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.
1600,2,361,['system'],I think that there could be a light rail system or electric buses. there is enough sunlight to make them 100% clean
1601,2,361,['system'],I think that we need a rail system for our city. Its a growing city with lost of bigger cities around it. A main rail system like a subway would make things much easier to get from place to place.
1602,2,361,['system'],I think we could bring back the streetcar in queens where the subway has low coverage. The streetcar would connect to the subway system which would be entirely rebuilt to accommodate new clean stations with solar panels and zero carbon foot print. This would connect with commuter and regional trains that would operate on an hourly scale.
1603,2,361,['system'],"I think we could have carpool vans that schedule drop offs for us in the city which could save gas and promote a green clean transportation system. Also, we could take turns as drivers, with GPS equipped and a convertible top for sunny days."
1604,2,361,['system'],"I think we should have a system like Uber set up here. Allow individuals to ""sign up"" to be drivers at the town and people can book rides via the net, text messaging, or by calling. I think this should be tax-exempt income because then the town has no issue with gas or any other expenses because it makes this more profitable to retired people or others who can't work. With the way free market works we would almost always have enough drivers!"
1605,2,361,['system'],"I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
1606,2,361,['system'],"I want a monorail system to run above street level (may be 20 feet up or so).  I want it to connect the suburbs to downtown, and circle the city.  It would run on magnets so that it would be extremely quiet.  It would be extremely fast.  I want it to provide a bird's eye view for commuters.  It would be a very safe way to travel, crime and personal safety would not be an issue."
1607,2,361,['system'],"I want to see the Chicagoland suburbs connected by a train. Most often if they are, it's because they're on the same line going to Chicago, but I'd like to see a system that moves between suburbs that aren't connected on the train line."
1608,2,361,['system'],"I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
1609,2,361,['system'],"I would create a bicycle rental system that was accessible to wheelchair. Pittsburgh created rental bicycles, but they left out disabled adults."
1610,2,361,['system'],I would have the Metro system extended further into Virginia to lessen the commute time.  I would also call for train stations that were more accessible and uses solar energy predominantly.
1611,2,361,['system'],I would imagine a street car type system that would connect each neighborhood.
1612,2,361,['system'],I would imagine an electric scooter or hoverboard rental system.  You could use them when going to and from a train station stop and to your final destination.  I imagine a rental system so that you could pick one up at a train or bus station to go your extra distance and return it when you return.  Renting would be a good option if you did not have your own with you or only use it with other public transportation. Bad weather is always an issue using these devices.
1613,2,361,['system'],"I would l to see a system of transportation where the service would do home pickups,similar to a bus, only the stops would be made at your home regularly for a monthly or yearly fee."
1614,2,361,['system'],"I would like a golf cart system that could get the kids to school on the paths, kind of like a bus system but on a much smaller scale."
1615,2,361,['system'],I would like a taxi like system that doesn't charge so high.
1616,2,361,['system'],I would like a teleporting system that can instantly take you from place to place
1617,2,361,['system'],I would like for there to be a trolley/tram system through main street in my town. Main street goes straight through Beaver Dam and Hartford and passes by all the important stores/stops.
1618,2,361,['system'],I would like it if the area I lived in used a bike sharing system like I have seen in some other major cities like Portland and Minneapolis.
1619,2,361,['system'],I would like our city to have a railway system like downtown Miami. Its computer operated and is over ground. This means it wont impact traffic at all. Its a fast and easy service and its going to make things easier for all.
1620,2,361,['system'],"I would like some sort of conveyor belt system or moving walkway (possibly with seats) in my city. It seems like it would be really nice for people, since people walk a lot here. Also, if there was a way to sit while moving, people could get work done and other things, while taking a 'slow ride' down the street (slower than a train, etc, so people can get on/ off while it's moving)."
1621,2,361,['system'],I would like to see a hover system that occupies the same route as roads and highways to bypass traffic.
1622,2,361,['system'],I would like to see a modern underground railway system installed in my neighbourhood. It would be noiseless and very fast. The railway will connect all the neighbourhood together making it easier to move around. The train would be making stops every half hour  to pick up and drop passengers.
1623,2,361,['system'],"I would like to see a People Mover connecting Trenton, Southgate, Taylor and Wyandotte. There seems to be a lot of people walking down streets such as Trenton and Eureka, and especially so in the winter. I can envision a rail system supported by local tax dollars very similar to the one to the north in Detroit. People around here are constantly complaining about weather conditions and global warming and I think my method could bring a lot of people together and solve a lot of the commuting problems around here. There are just so many cars and it seems there is an average of just 1.5 people per vehicle. It is rather said. I really would want to push toward the people mover rail systems."
1624,2,361,['system'],"I would like to see a public transportation system, funded by the government and running non-stop.  Possibly employing people in an uber style privately owned vehicle service.  Or some car pool ideas."
1625,2,361,['system'],I would like to see a solar powered train system
1626,2,361,['system'],"I would like to see a system built around ""people movers"" - similar to the ride that was once at Disneyland.  It would run underneath the ground - under the traffic.  Each car would hold one or two people with large reclining chairs and a docking station for your laptop so you can watch movies, play games or actually do work."
1627,2,361,['system'],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
1628,2,361,['system'],I would like to see a system that would be quicker for pickups and drop offs. This would mean vehicles similar to busses but smaller and more efficient.
1629,2,361,['system'],"I would like to see a transportation system that can be used for professional reasons, or personal, but not both."
1630,2,361,['system'],"I would like to see an advanced transportation system that involved driverless cars.  The idea is the same as using a taxi but without a driver.  Like Uber, you would use your mobile device to order a car and control the experience.  The car shows up at your door, takes you to your destination and you are billed for the ride. It would save me thousands of dollars in the cost to own, maintain, insure and license my own personal car."
1631,2,361,['system'],I would like to see an expanded light rail system with more of a neighborhood connection.  Right now our light rail pretty much just connects the Downtown core with the airport.
1632,2,361,['system'],"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
1633,2,361,['system'],I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
1634,2,361,['system'],I would love a rail system to be installed in our city going north/south along the coast.
1635,2,361,['system'],"I would love for there to a more intergrated train system in my city (specifically my neighborhood.) I'd love to be able to hop on a train (or streetcar) and be able to transfer to a larger rail system that would take me to other cities, etc. Something like what european cities have."
1636,2,361,['system'],I would love if my neighborhood had a rail system that worked from magnets and floated along the rail at high speeds.  I wish that the cars were individual and that I could get in and select from a list of destinations.  I would like my own car and to be able to bring my dogs with me.  It would be fast and smooth and work with minimal power.
1637,2,361,['system'],I would love to see a light rail system in my community. I am thinking of above ground trains that would run to the various suburbs and take people to various local stops. These trains should run a regular schedule so people can use them to commute.
1638,2,361,['system'],"I'd like to see shuttle trams in my area. It's a small section based urban area that has about four different areas all residents will have to visit at some point in time. If we had a shuttle system that specifically transported people from a central point to the four primary destinations it would incredibly reduce the use of fossil fuels, traffic, and accidents in the area."
1639,2,361,['system'],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
1640,2,361,['system'],"I'd love a system that is like Uber but just for cheap, shared rides home from the train. It'd cost less than a buck for everyone and operate as a shuttle for people that live within 5 mins of the train."
1641,2,361,['system'],I'd love for some sort of shuttle system that worked at late hours between major points in town
1642,2,361,['system'],"I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
1643,2,361,['system'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
1644,2,361,['system'],"If we could all just travel through human sized and safe pods that take us from place to place like the banks vacuum system that would probably be the fastest, safest way."
1645,2,361,['system'],"In my city, it is almost impossible to not having a car since the public transportation is not that good. However, car ownership can be quite expensive. Car sharing could reduce the cost of having a car, we can build a system that anyone can use a ""public"" car that can be shared after paying a certain fixed cost up-front and hourly/daily rate afterward."
1646,2,361,['system'],In my neighborhood I think the best type of transportation system would be an elevated railway like a tram at disney world it would make commuting between neighboring cities far easier and the technology would make commutes more timely.
1647,2,361,['system'],In my neighborhood it would be like a monorail system. Something that you could get on at one stop and take it to another are you would want to go. Connecting locations you would visit.
1648,2,361,['system'],"In my neighborhood, I would like to see some sort of updated streetcar system with solar panels on the top of the street cats,, some sort of energy capture technology on the tracks."
1649,2,361,['system'],In the future we could develop a pod system that takes each person directly to the place they want to go.  A pod station could be set up and all you do is type the address of the location where you want to go and it takes you there in seconds.  This would require some infrastructure and technology to build.
1650,2,361,['system'],"In the future, there will be electric powered vehicle system. There will be transportation centers with different sized vehicles for rent for a small fee. The vehicles will range in size from one person scooters to six person vehicles. They will be rented on an hourly basis."
1651,2,361,['system'],"It is similar to the monorail at Wald Disney world. It goes all around the town and stops when people use an app and state they need a pickup. It can go to individual streets and addresses because it needs no rails, but can use multiple-line systems to navigate the town. It makes scheduled stops, but can also be called by the app. It is free, paid for by local and state taxes, and very clean and quick. People use it for a wide variety of uses, from nights on the town, to grocery shopping, to work commute. It is very safe, clean and fun."
1652,2,361,['system'],It would be a free system (every family in the neighborhood would have to contribute $300-$400 as a one time fee). Then the bus would run through the neighborhood every hour and take you to anywhere in the neighborhood that you need to go! You would be able to text the driver before hand of where you are going.
1653,2,361,['system'],It would be a new school bus system that runs on renewable energy. No more gas would be needed to get the kids to school and back home. Making our city one more step greener and setting the bar high!
1654,2,361,['system'],"It would be a super fast train system. It would be so fast that my husband could get to his job, which is ten miles away in 5 minutes. It would be super popular and efficient. Everyone from business people to house wifes would want to use it."
1655,2,361,['system'],"It would be a very good idea to come up with some kind of effective carpooling system in my area. I live in a rural place, but there could be a central park-and-ride lot built along the major thoroughfare to make carpooling simpler. Perhaps an app could be developed to run the carpooling system so that everyone is on the same page."
1656,2,361,['system'],It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
1657,2,361,['system'],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
1658,2,361,['system'],"It would be better if the government will create a new transpo scheme wherein there will be a separate lane for buses, a separate late wherein it is closed for every other vehicle and there are stations for the customers just like in train/subway system, card system will be used in the stations estimated time of the next bus arrival shown on screen and it can also be checked through a mobile app"
1659,2,361,['system'],It would be cool (although pretty difficult to actually create) to have a gondola lift public transportation system that had cars that could travel over the streets and take people places avoiding traffic! There'd be stops that had elevators and stairs to get up to them and basically they'd just be suspended a bit above the streets and you could travel nicely between them over all the traffic below.
1660,2,361,['system'],It would be cool it we had a monorail type system throughout the neighborhood that does a simple circle and takes kids or adults from the neighboorhood into the town/school area.
1661,2,361,['system'],"It would be great for our city to offer more access to the rails.  We could use an updated rail system that would make traveling to our larger cities in the state faster, more available, and yet still affordable.  It could bring more people to live in our city if they could travel fast to the big city and help grow our town here.  Our town is terribly depressed and I think that having a high-speed train or just general more options to travel through it would bring a massive amount of revenue into the city."
1662,2,361,['system'],"It would be hard to have a viable system in my neighborhood, because this area is so scattered. I think the best idea would be a bikeshare; inexpensive access to bikes would be a great idea! The bigger issue would be making our area bike-friendly. That's the part the requires creativity. We could add extra lanes and then add over/underpasses at intersections to make bikes not just inexpensive, but even more time-effective than driving."
1663,2,361,['system'],"It would be small individual electric golf cart-like cars that run along the edge of the sidewalks every couple of minutes that people can hop into to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, post office, etc.  they operate from out of a common neighborhood ""hub"" so each system covers a small area.  People can just call one from an app on their smart phone, they are charged a small fee, then after the trip, the cart remains in one area until it is called again or it returns to the hub to be charged."
1664,2,361,['system'],Its new blacktop in a grid system.
1665,2,361,['system'],"Kind of a monorail system that goes from stops in neighborhoods and takes people to a stop near the stores, etc.  Open top with a cover, no need to heat or cool, wouldn't run in extreme weather."
1666,2,361,['system'],Light rail system that reaches even the furthest suburbs.
1667,2,361,['system'],Make an interstate system that is powered by a conveyor belt.
1668,2,361,['system'],"Monorail through the city! Just like Disneyland, this city-wide system allows you to see the city from a bird's eye! Simply get on at one of the many stations around town and enjoy your ride without stops, traffic or bad weather. The rails above the city means growth can continue without getting in the way of transport, and means you can watch the world below!"
1669,2,361,['system'],"My city is right on the ocean and there are many canals within the city as well, so I think a kind of transportation system with water taxis or some kind of water buses would be really useful. In a lot of cases I think this kind of transportation would be faster and more accessible to people, especially if it was willing to pick people up at designated locations or even right off their own docks for those who have them."
1670,2,361,['system'],my city needs a subway system badly. A subway system would run in a star shaped pattern through the city and eliminate the terrible traffic in my city
1671,2,361,['system'],"My city would benefit from an elevated and enclosed train line. Regional rail is the preferred choice for many commuters but is unreliable and frustrating due to weather and traffic related delays. Though the infrastructure investment would be great, we are in need of an overhaul anyway and should improve the current system."
1672,2,361,['system'],"My idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood is a series of really big tubes, with padding, and occasionally air holes, with mesh filters to prevent bugs and large debris from getting in.  The tubes would be places alongside all the streets, and be at a constant forward vacuum, with enough lessening of suction to allow people to grasp a handle at their stop and get out.   (If you miss your stop, you just ride around until it comes up again, pushing yourself towards the right tube as it comes towards you.)



Collision between travelers would need to be solved, as well as how to clean up any errant body fluids left by travelers; perhaps a daily purge at midnight, where the suction could be increased exponentially and all materials dumped in a pile, on a rotating schedule, on different people's lawns.   



This system has the benefit of a very low carbon footprint, and lends itself well to spontaneous exclamations of 'cowabunga'.  



Implementation note: This idea may require anti-gravity research, in addition to a lot of suction."
1673,2,361,['system'],"My idea for public transportation would include an underground rail system powered by magnets. Because of the varied climate as well as prevalence natural disasters in my area, having the system underground seems like the best idea. The train would stop a lot more often than normal trains; At the end of every street at least. It would have a separate exit system in order to not lose quite as much time loading and unloading passengers."
1674,2,361,['system'],"My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."
1675,2,361,['system'],"My neighborhood currently has no bike lanes, so I would imagine a system with renewable transportation integrated into the layout. Spaces for bikes, electric car re-charging stations, etc."
1676,2,361,['system'],"my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops. People will be able to travel to any part of the world without going through airports and flight connections. There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
1677,2,361,['system'],My neighborhood has no transportation system. So a simple bus would help.
1678,2,361,['system'],My neighborhood needs a car share system between individuals. It would be similar to Uber but you would be able to drive someone else's car for a monthly fee.
1679,2,361,['system'],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
1680,2,361,['system'],My new transportation system would be a golf cart system. We have many elderly people who would enjoy being able to get around using golf carts. It would be a wa around the city without having to use the highway.
1681,2,361,['system'],"My transportation suggestion (in my town) would be to avoid the freeways and allow me to get to work using a rail way-type system.  This would be either underground or overground.  This is not an something that we see on the west coast a lot, so it would be very helpful to many commuters in the town I live."
1682,2,361,['system'],"My transportation system would be for people to enter their own personal, flying car. The destination would be put into the onboard computer. And then the flying car would automatically proceed on the matrix."
1683,2,361,['system'],"One Idea I've always had was sky trams. It would operate just like your traditional tram system but instead of a point A to point B ride. You would have an additional 5 to 10 stops on a linear path, to support the stops I would use a magnetic rail system, instead of the old wire cable system. This would cut down on over crowding in terms of public and private transportation."
1684,2,361,['system'],"Our City has no nearby neighbors. Any future ideas are going to require a rail system, preferably something fast like japanese trains. Maglev technology which will allow faster travel from coastal towns and cities to the capital."
1685,2,361,['system'],"Our new transportation system would involve golf carts.  Several roads would be designated as golf-cart-only areas and include parking.  New paths could be created because they take up less space than normal roads and even designated lanes on existing roads could be defined to use existing infrastructure.  The environment would be healthier with less pollutants, crowding would be less due to smaller size vehicles, and it would even encourage healthier lifestyles out in the air and sunshine."
1686,2,361,['system'],Perhaps a system where you can rent out bicycles or motorbikes to get to where you need to go. You could hold a lot of them in one area and make it easy to check out the bike and then return it later. It would help getting around for people who can't afford a car service to take them around the city but also for people who prefer to be health conscious and also want to save money by biking around the city.
1687,2,361,['system'],"point to point lift system, like ski lifts. small town with lots of lakes and sunshine"
1688,2,361,['system'],"Railway tunnels off of the highways (outdoor subways) to provide a fast paced mode of transportation on busy streets that work with a system like uber that will have drivers readily available at each location. More for suburban areas, not large city areas that have subway/rail systems."
1689,2,361,['system'],remove all non commercial traffic.  have extensive light rail connected to robust subway system.  have storage containers deliver large goods.
1690,2,361,['system'],Rent cars for a day. Each city has a system where you can rent cars for a certain amount of time for a fee.
1691,2,361,['system'],ROAD TRANSPORT - CAR IS THE BEST TRANSPORT SYSTEM TO TRAVEL (WE ARE FREE FROM POLLUTION AND ACCIDENTS)
1692,2,361,['system'],"Scooters or bikes for rent put in areas that are too far to walk but for people who can't afford a car, uber, or taxi. You could rent them for a day and return them to the area that evening or keep them for another day's charge like a Redbox sort of system."
1693,2,361,['system'],"Shared bike system - everyone has access to a system of bicycles that are evenly distributed throughout the city via ""bike parking lots."" Punch in a code, get a bike for the day, return it to another station later."
1694,2,361,['system'],solar powered mini bus system - florida
1695,2,361,['system'],Some kind of public transportation like light rail that goes nearby would be ideal. If we could have a light rail or subway system that connects the city to the suburbs that would greatly improve the traffic situation.
1696,2,361,['system'],"Some sort of free bicycle rides.  It would work by having you use a credit card (so people cannot steal bicycles) as a deposit.   Here's how it would work.  You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.    If you don't return the bike, it would charge your card aka ask for a retransmission of said packet.  That's all I have for now."
1697,2,361,['system'],some type of elevated train/bus system that didnt use the same roads as cars
1698,2,361,['system'],Some type of underground or above-ground monorail system to help with the massive traffic problem in my area. With stations in key locations that are unobtrusive to the overall community.
1699,2,361,['system'],Something akin to a streetcar or trolley bus system could be very useful in my city.  It would have its own designated lane and be a useful public transportation alternative.
1700,2,361,['system'],"Something like a chair lift system except that it is very fast and reliable. It would be located in the most frequented hubs in the city and each chair would be a single seat so there is no worry about people being isolated in ""pods"" with strangers which could be dangerous."
1701,2,361,['system'],"Subway system underground, moving sidewalks on the ground"
1702,2,361,['system'],"Tampa, FL is one of the largest metro areas in the country without any sort of rail system, and traffic is bad. I would love to see a commuter rail system in our town, with a downtown hub and then lines extending north to the Wesley Chapel/Lutz area, out to Brandon, and then another line out to the Westshore/Airport area."
1703,2,361,['system'],THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS VERY USEFUL TO TRANSPORT ALL THE PRODUCTS AND ITS TIME SAVING
1704,2,361,['system'],"The cat bus is a new public transportation system where riders get to interact with 2 or more cats! The cats will be in cages, but they will be larger cages so they have room to roam. There will also be an enclosed cage where the cats who are too excited from the social stimulation can be alone."
1705,2,361,['system'],The employer would work on a system to have every employee's address and map it.  Then a very large carpool could be created to make it easy for everyone to get there on time and save them money.  The employer could also provide the bus or van to make it even better.
1706,2,361,['system'],"The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
1707,2,361,['system'],"The future transport system would be something which would be very unique, we may see air-car and air-bikes in future with different lanes distributed for them. These would fly at a very low altitude and would achieve very quick speed."
1708,2,361,['system'],"The future transportation system in me neighborhood is going to consist of driverless vehicles that hover and travel with the help of magnetism. The vehicles have built in solar panels that operate throughout the city 24/7. These vehicles all have routines they follow everyday so people just have to transfer according to where they want to go. On the other hand, if people want to own their own vehicle then it is possible. They can travel where ever they want to and all they have to do is to recharge their solar battery in the sunlight."
1709,2,361,['system'],"The future transportation system in my neighborhood is called air cars. They were created in an effort to reduce carbon footprints and try to save our planet. These vehicles are much more lighter than regular cars and can be upgraded to fly. The best thing about these cars is that they operate solely on air. What is even better is that there is a filter that intakes air and cleans it by trapping dirty air in a compartment only able to be removed by manufacturers. This is our last ditch effort to save the Earth, so buy a Clean Car."
1710,2,361,['system'],The future transportation system in my neighborhood would possibly incorporate traffic light systems that would detect the amount of traffic and flow to better keep traffic moving and prevent long lines and wait times at intersections therefor reducing trip times and automobile emissions.
1711,2,361,['system'],The neighborhood needs a rail system that runs adjacent to the highway. This would go from major city to major city with the same stops as for those that drive.
1712,2,361,['system'],"The suburbs are not currently served by the bus system. I believe that each suburb should get its own bus, which will take riders to a bus stop in the city. There, they may catch another bus or walk to their destination."
1713,2,361,['system'],The system will be based off cable cars.  It's cheaper and easier to put up than bridges or building tunnels.  They will have their own traffic free paths.  The paths can even intersect by having the cables much higher than the other line's.  There can be platforms every so often so people can get on and off but not too many as to keep cost and commute time down.
1714,2,361,['system'],The terrain where I live can make public transportation hard to develop. It is very hilly. There is a main highway/route that runs straight enough that a rail system could work. It would be good to get people to the more populated section that could then hook up easily with other modes of public transportation (which do not exist right now but it could be done). It would not be high speed as there would need to be several stops along the way. It could be done with an electric source that would not be harmful for pollution.
1715,2,361,['system'],"The transportation system in my neighborhood consists of each person driving their own cars. Occasionally, people will carpool, but there is no public transportation and walking is not feasable."
1716,2,361,['system'],"The transportation system is much into the future where you get into a cylinder and press your destination on the buttons, somewhat like an elevator. The tube launches and within minutes, you arrive at your destination within the city limits. The cylinder, if you can imagine, is one like what you put your deposits in at a bank window."
1717,2,361,['system'],The transportation system would be a combination of roads with cars and a railroad track. All of the cars would be connected and be able to drive themselves. Cars would all be on tracks and controlled by the car itself. This would lower accidents and allow for better traffic. Cars would be able to accelerate much faster as there is no driver intervention and you don't have to wait for other cars to accelerate or worry about where other cars are going.
1718,2,361,['system'],"The transportation system would be like the sidewalks that move in the airport, you would just stand on the sidewalk and it would move you where you need to go."
1719,2,361,['system'],"There could be a train type of system but not using metal tracks like they have in europe (above ground?)  The trolley or bus could be made to target things people wanna go do instead of just transportation.  Like grocery shopping or night out to watch movie theatre and that way everyone is grouped and the businesses upsales, etc can develop better because of that."
1720,2,361,['system'],"There could be some kind of light rail system for the people.  It would make stops at malls, universities, grocery stores, and various event centers."
1721,2,361,['system'],There is no bus system so my idea is for a bus system in my area.  I live in a suburbs of a small town and there is no bus out here.  It would be nice to have one.  Sometimes I don't have access to a car and maybe this bus could help me get to the store or church.  I would also like the bus system to be able to take me to the small town to go shopping and stuff.
1722,2,361,['system'],There is no subway system here
1723,2,361,['system'],There needs to be a new system that picks you up at your place. A bus system that you can call to pick you up and the closest one will come. Kind of like a taxi but a bus so it can carry a lot more people.
1724,2,361,['system'],There should be a roapway system by which local deliveries should be done by transporting items in tram and dropping them at specific points then the owner can arrange to collect his items.
1725,2,361,['system'],There should be a system where you can call for the bus to pick you up instead of it stopping at certain stops. It would go to the certain stops also but also pick you up if it has extra space in the time it has so it can save the Earth with carpooling.
1726,2,361,['system'],There should be a train system in our county. It should have a magnetic railway so it can be as green as possible and use light power.
1727,2,361,['system'],There will be a system for elderly and handicapped people. They will pick up people from their houses and take them where they need to go.
1728,2,361,['system'],there will be driver-less cars and a lite rail system. There will still be some (free) bus transportation to fill in the gaps and help negate the need for new roads
1729,2,361,['system'],There would be a pay-to-use bicycle system similar to the Citi bicycles in New York City. It would allow people to exercise while getting to their location quickly. It would also relieve traffic congestion.
1730,2,361,['system'],This area could really use a super speed train that goes much faster than traffic. It could travel above the road system and would save tons of time for many people.
1731,2,361,['system'],"This idea is called 'Rolling taxi'. The system is a large ball. single large ball. Inside the ball, people can sit . People sit or stand at the centre of the ball. As ball rolls on specially made road the centre region doesn't move. The centre region where people sit is attached to the  inner surface of the ball in a special manner so that people do not move. The speed and direction of the ball can control using technology. The ball roll all across the city with people inside on a special track. Speed is high and expense is less. Also it is fun."
1732,2,361,['system'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
1733,2,361,['system'],"This is a transportation system that delivers food directly to people's houses. It exists in a large city and people will use an App on their phones to get food delivered to their house. They can enter the restaurant, find out what they want, and someone will deliver the food item by any mean they choose whether it be car or bicycle or walking. The app will also store people's favorite orders at their restaurants so they don't have to think about what to order."
1734,2,361,['system'],"This is about a single user system. It is similar to a bicycle. But it's does not run on road. It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable. We take it from home or rent from government."
1735,2,361,['system'],"This new transportation system is a bullet train in the sky, able to span around the neighborhood with up to 700 passengers in under two minutes. It's sleek silver coat is never late, and always early to make sure everyone gets where they need to go. The rails float there in the sky, ready to carry this majestic beauty to the ends of the neighborhood making sure everyone is early"
1736,2,361,['system'],"This system is like an invisible gondola ride, with individual pods that up to a party of 4 can get into, running on magnetic lines."
1737,2,361,['system'],"This system would be made up of a continuous stream of drivers of small vehicles.  The vehicles might be three-wheelers or some other form of small, motorized vehicles.  Besides the driver, the vehicles would only have space for two other occupants.  The vehicles would continue on the same busy stretch of road.  In other words, they would be on a fixed path.  Also, there would be a large number of these vehicles, a constant stream, so the passenger would never have to wait longer than a minute or two.  The passengers would have prepaid for the service, so there would be no need to exchange money with the driver."
1738,2,361,['system'],This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
1739,2,361,['system'],"Ticket sharing system for people who make infrequent trips into the city, or suddenly need to do several trips in a row. A group of people could collectively share a commuter pass for the train or bus system. It would be like a Netflix of commuter passes. The ticket could be held in an existing business or maybe a library, and the ticket would be checked out like a book. People would pay each day they hold the ticket."
1740,2,361,['system'],transport mode system
1741,2,361,['system'],Uber like school bus system
1742,2,361,['system'],"Ultimate monkey bars.  People are too fat in my area, forcing them to travel via monkey bars across the neighborhood should help not only with emission decrease, but weight decrease as well!  There will just be an overhead system running the lengths of the sidewalks at 7 foot high so no one gets hurt if they fall."
1743,2,361,['system'],"Unfortunately, I live in a very small/rural town, so future transportation system would likely be simple public bus transit."
1744,2,361,['system'],"Use CNG Gas in Autos, Taxi, Buses and Other Public Transport System.

1746,2,361,['system'],vaccum system of tubes like at a bank.  High speed escalators.  Conveyor system for cars on the interstate.
1747,2,361,['system'],We already have bus system.  I think people that live close together and work at same place the boss should give incentive to carpool together.
1748,2,361,['system'],We could have helicopters that move from certain places in the city to farther ones.  Somewhat like a light rail system but from different ends of the city.  It could make jumps to each different port that would be faster than any other travel.
1749,2,361,['system'],we could incorporate a public bus system.
1750,2,361,['system'],We could really use a tram system!
1751,2,361,['system'],we have a unique opportunity to leave for the next generation a transportation system better than the one we inherited.
1752,2,361,['system'],"we need dedicated motorcycle streets, preferably underground, i live in a very populated city (not LA status but still very urban) and ive often thought that a small underground road system built primarily for two wheeled street vehicles would not only cut down on traffic but the pollotuion created could them be trapped and prevented from being released into the atmosphere... it would cause motorcycle sales to skyrocket and there by provide another added economic benefit."
1753,2,361,['system'],We ought to revisit the trolley system because the buses in New York City are plagued by heavy traffic. We should have electric trolleys on main thoroughfares. It worked in the old days. Sometimes old ideas mixed with new technology is GENIUS!
1754,2,361,['system'],We should come up with a car service system that can be computer operated and you can have it just by dialing a number. It would be like a railway system but with cars.
1755,2,361,['system'],We should have an underground subway system. For a city as large as the one I live in it would make sense. It would be faster for everyone and clear the roads of buses that clog up traffic during rush hour.
1756,2,361,['system'],"We will have cars that can lift off the ground and ""fly"" with a air propel system. This would be fast enough for them to travel in that city area without hitting any others."
1757,2,361,['system'],what is needed is a tubular powered zipline based transportation system. a combination of pnewumatic and electric power will propel people from place to place in a similar manner to a ski lift except it would just be a small tube that has a chain of sorts running in it along the sidewalks. all you would have to do is to have a harness on and when you need to go to one of the destinations you hook on to the line that is color coded for your destination and cruise on down there. Not the most comfortable way to travel but the infrastructure for a neighborhood would be relatively inexpensive.
1758,2,361,['system'],"What we need is a better public transportation system that services the East end of the city.  Perhaps a bullet shuttle that will pick up in certain areas of the East End, and shuttle t predetermined locations within the city such as the downtown area, in addition to other areas."
1759,2,361,['system'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
1760,2,361,['system'],"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."
1761,3,328,['car'],A bike path that has a divider between the road and the bike path. A dedicated bike path that has a sense of security could encourage more people to bike around town since they wouldn't need to share the road with cars.

1767,3,328,['car'],"A car pooling app. Non-drivers and those looking for regular rides who normally carpool would join the community and hook up with drivers who are going to their general destination. There would be a monthly fee, which would lowered and even be removed if someone drives/uses their car enough. For example, it's $5 per month, and every time YOU drive it goes down by .50 cents. There's incentive for both non-drivers (a small fee for rides) and drivers (free membership, maybe some gas reimbursement)."
1768,3,328,['car'],A car that scans particular people before allowing it to run to prevent thieves.
1769,3,328,['car'],"A car that woeks with the magnetic forces of earth, applying a system that can take advantage of all the force that can be generated. It can also work with other alternative energies such as solar power or wind power. All of these energies mixed in one idea and also fossil fuels but to a minimum scale."
1770,3,328,['car'],"A central hub for a ridesharing service that provides cars for small groups to take to neighboring towns. I live in a rural area, a few minutes from a very small village. The nearest SMALL city is about 30 minutes away, and the nearest decent sized city is almost an hour away. A ridesharing service would make accessing these places much easier, and if the company provided the car (for a fee, of course), those without vehicles could be serviced."
1771,3,328,['car'],A community system that is managed electronically and requests cars any time of day. All cars are electric and will take you anywhere you want to go for a set charge and there are maintenance teams that come and clean cars during the day.

1773,3,328,['car'],A electric scooter sharing program for getting around town without having to drive a car and use too much gas or take up too much space.
1774,3,328,['car'],"A fare based system would allow heavy car users to pay more and light ones to pay less for gas, tolls, etc.  Their car will have a gps tracker to see where and when they go (downtown, rush hour, etc.)  This will help the people who don't need to drive as much and tax the ones that are always on the road."
1775,3,328,['car'],"A fleet of automated cars that have pre-programmed destinations in them. You use your credit or debit card to pay. Swipe it and then pick your destination and it takes you there, charging you based on how far away it is and not based on time so it's better than a cab, and also uses the new robotic cars."
1776,3,328,['car'],"A fleet of cheap, reliable, automated taxi cars. The cars would drive automatically after an input was made for the destination. These cars would be self charging with paint that has solar energy potential."

1782,3,328,['car'],"A human-sized slot-car system.  Where cars run independently self-driving down a track through electricity like a trolley car, but just big enough for a regular sized family (in other words size of a regular car).  In order to move faster cars can link up by matching speed and then essentially ""plugging"" into the car ahead of it.  This could go much faster than regular cars and not have any of the problems associated with regular self-drive cars seeing as they move on a track."
1783,3,328,['car'],A imagine a system like Ã¼ber but with driverless technology. And I imagine people renting on car for a group of people to commute.
1784,3,328,['car'],"A magnetic railway car, like a trolley, that moves and stops by people pressing buttons on the side of the road"
1785,3,328,['car'],"A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.  They would park their cars before entering the city, and use this quick system for getting around.  No more crowded, expensive parking in the city."
1786,3,328,['car'],"A moving sidewalk - like the ones you would see in an airport to help expedite movement between terminals.  Around my area there are a lot of close shops, so people could walk, but getting loads of bags home would be difficult.  Having mechanical walkways would enable people to do their shopping but reduce their need to use cars, and at the same time set all their bags down so they don't have to figure out how to lug them home, especially if they've purchased something heavy.  It could also allow people to get where they need to go faster, if they continue to walk along the moving sidewalk.  They could sit alongside regular sidewalks, so people who still wanted to go out for a walk and get some fresh air could do so.  The mechanical/moving sidewalks would be made out of metal, look like a flat escalator, have hand railings, and each side of the road would have a sidewalk that goes the same way as traffic."
1787,3,328,['car'],A network of publicly available electric cars will drive around the city in the most efficient manner possible. People will use apps to call a car to get them =from one of many pickup spots and drop them off before they go on the next passenger.

1792,3,328,['car'],"A new taxi service that uses mopeds rather than cars. It's something used quite frequently in other countries (such as Brazil). You would be able to call for assistance or simply stop them off the side of the road (just like a taxi, obviously)."
1793,3,328,['car'],"A new transportation idea would be to have bikes that can be rented.  I have seen this in some towns such as Austin, Texas.  Where you can find a bank of rental bikes every couple of blocks.  How awesome would it be if this was more normal and people could choose to ride a bike to the store to grab a loaf of bread or something, rather than getting in the car and wasting gas and adding to pollution."
1794,3,328,['car'],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
1795,3,328,['car'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood could be the use of drones to fly individuals in and around town, or to far off destinations. The drones would fly like helicopters, but can  can also be controlled using a remote control. Unlike a car which can transport several passengers, the drone would be only be able to transport one person."
1796,3,328,['car'],A new transportation system.... Self driving cars/ trolleys (absolutely no tracks or special lanes for the trolley just self driving)
1797,3,328,['car'],"a new type of rail system with certain drop off points, but the rail system is above the road so it doesnt interfere with people driving cars."
1798,3,328,['car'],"A public transport system with self-driving cars. You go online, select your destination and then order a self driving car to pick you up."
1799,3,328,['car'],"A Railway system for cars, like something out of minority report. You can still drive on the roads but the speed limit is controlled and there is never any accidents because you input your destination into a program in the individual cars and let the railway system get you there."
1800,3,328,['car'],"A ride pool system like uber that uses vans to take people to similar destinations. Like an employee car pool, but done by a third party. Blend of employee car pool, and lyft line (I think that's what it's called)."
1801,3,328,['car'],"A roaming private car that you can pay by the mile or carpool. Basically, the car would go up and down the street or area and put trips together (like going to the grocery store or the same shopping center) and split the costs, so it can be as affordable as a bus but more private."
1802,3,328,['car'],A self driving lawn mower.  Use the technology for self driving cars to create a self driving lawn mower.

1804,3,328,['car'],A small personal car that ran on solar energy that was no larger than a bike.  It could be stored on a bike rack and had enough energy to go 15 miles on a charge.  Charging time would only be an hour if and when it needed to plug into electric.  The biggest thing is that it would keep the occupant dry.

It could be like 30-40 a month, there is a microchip in the car that can tell if you don't belong there, and it alerts the police.  This lane money could go to taxes/education and the like.  The lane is only restricted to paying customers during regular work hours.   Any other time it's not policed, and anyone can use it."
1808,3,328,['car'],"a subway type system that would have personal cars for people.  after typing in your destination, the car you were in would choose the quickest route within the city system of tracks permitted to get you to your destination. futuristic."
1809,3,328,['car'],"A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."
1810,3,328,['car'],A system like Uber where people can collaborate and find others who have extra space in their car for a sort of taxi/carpool service.
1811,3,328,['car'],A system where cars are left with the keys in them but they require a passcode to unlock that is only obtained by renting the car. It can then be parked in special spots around the city for the next person to use.

1813,3,328,['car'],"A train to the beach.  The beach is about an hour from our town (or three hours with summer traffic), and all traffic to the beach comes through our town due to an important bridge.  We could have a train that leaves from our town, or other stops nearby, and then expresses to the beach.  People would need extra room for luggage - or you could couple it with a luggage delivery system.  It would cut down on time to the beach and the number of cars on the road."
1814,3,328,['car'],"A transportation system would include wide use of self-driving cars to facilitate efficiency and safety. Cars may be privately owned, or there may be a pay-as-you go or contract type system if you do not wish to own a vehicle. There would also be a total bike lane system for those who prefer to ride bicycles. The bike lanes would be much safer than what exists now."
1815,3,328,['car'],"A trolley, or electric street car system."
1816,3,328,['car'],A type of uber service that transports more than a car of people.
1817,3,328,['car'],"A walking pathway across every rooftop in the city.   It would cut down on danger from cars, and it'd be fun to see the scenery.  This could easily be constructed with some good, sturdy planks.  Line them up on the roof, screw them in or hammer them in.  Every building would have a fire escape on it for easy access back to the street.  This would save much time as you could go ""as the eagle flies."" straight across the roofs."
1818,3,328,['car'],A way that cars can connect with other cars so if you are all going to the same place they can connect GPS and it would allow the cars to follow automatically the car in the front and use less gas that way.
1819,3,328,['car'],"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."

1822,3,328,['car'],"Alternative energy powered vehicles. Using electricity, sunlight, and other renewable sources can be beneficial to society. Imagine if every car, motorcycle, bus, stopped using gas."
1823,3,328,['car'],"An alternative transport that would be excellent would be a monorail in my city.  It could be run with electricity, with many train cars, and go along the main north south route.  You could get almost anywhere in quickly and easily if it went along that route."
1824,3,328,['car'],"An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
1825,3,328,['car'],"An automated car pickup system. You connect via an app on a computer, tablet, or cell phone and let the system know the time you need to leave; it then sends a size appropriate vehicle to your door to pick you up and on your way you go!"
1826,3,328,['car'],"An automated system of cabs. Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."
1827,3,328,['car'],"An autonomous car service. This would require the building and investing into self driving cars. You would have a mobile app you can call and request a car and one is immediately dispatched to you. Using your phone you tell it where you want to go. It navigates there. Best of all, this would be free - or very cheap."
1828,3,328,['car'],"An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
1829,3,328,['car'],An idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood would be to use cars with automated driving that would allow the person(s) to input the destination and go about doing other things while the car drove itself to that location.
1830,3,328,['car'],"An underground network system in the neighborhood, like a subway but only bikes and small motorcycles can travel through. This will be a good way to protect against the weather and steer clear of any incoming cars."
1831,3,328,['car'],An underground rail system would be great. That way you could get around without having to get stuck in traffic.  There are so many cars in this area that we are known for our traffic.
1832,3,328,['car'],"An underground tunnel system just for people, bikes and mopeds.  The idea is that all the cars and congestion can stay up above and people can safely walk or transport themselves around without worrying about cars and busses getting in the way or being run over by them.  Every so often there is a ramp that allows you to exit, as well as natural light through grates and proper ventilation.  It would also be a great way to get around when it snows."
1833,3,328,['car'],Another idea would placing electricity-generating devices at intersections where cars come to a stop for a red light that would recharge the battery of hybrid/electric cars. This could be powered by solar panels attached to lighting poles along the road.
1834,3,328,['car'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
1835,3,328,['car'],"As a networking solution, all cars produced after 2017 whether self-driving or not will be installed with small wi-fi repeaters that work on the new bandwidth. They will broadcast wifi from 100 meters in each direction. The tech will be an industry standard and will be powered on at all times anonymously. Funding will come from tolls from my tube idea."
1836,3,328,['car'],"As a socially awkward recluse who doesn't drive, I want to be able to call an automated system for a driver-less taxi. I want the option to pay online via debit/credit, gift card or Paypal or have the option to insert bills into the car door before being able to enter. I'd like to be able to pick my music genres for the ride as well."
1837,3,328,['car'],"Automated cars that can come pick you up at the push of a button on android or apple devices, and directly from that device, you can pick from a map where you want to go. Submit your payment, and off you go!"

1842,3,328,['car'],"Automated taxi service. Would have several dispatch stations in key areas of city. Person could call for a ride from an app on their phone and it would send a car to them. The software could calculate rate for the trip and make you pay before as a confirmation before sending a car out. Car could then drive customer to said destination.  Self driveable cars that could provide a much better service than the often RUDE cab drivers could provide. Plus, I trust a robot way more than some of these morons driving!"
1843,3,328,['car'],Autonomous car transport to our desired destination.  You are able to pay and call a car with you cell phone.
1844,3,328,['car'],Autonomous cars that you can order rides from through an app similar to Uber.
1845,3,328,['car'],"autonomous vehicles abound. there are shared autonomous vehicles that can be called by neighborhood members. you may travel to destinations within your town only. the cost is shared by real estate tax. the benefit is a drastic reduction in traffic congestion, as much fewer cars are needed."

1853,3,328,['car'],Cars that are Google GPS operated that are car pool cars like taxis. You pre pay and schedule ahead of time and then they come and pick you up on time and take you to work on time. It costs the same as gas so it is just efficient and environment saving.
1854,3,328,['car'],Cars that can connect their GPS's so when they are all going to similar locations they can switch on auto drive and so all the computers can drive automatically. Once the closest stop comes around it'll make it so you have to drive the rest of the way.
1855,3,328,['car'],"Cars that can drive themselves, but people don't own them. They're a service provided by the city and you sign up for it and call when you need a car and the nearest one comes to you"
1856,3,328,['car'],"Cars utilize an antenna again to capture radiowaves and microwaves in the air.  They then use these waves and transfer them into energy to charge a battery.

1857,3,328,['car'],Charging station for electric cars that also has lots of electronic device chargeers.
1858,3,328,['car'],"Chicago - Chicago has a great system and phenomenal public transport. As far as transportation though I wish the highways in the city acted like slotted cars, similar to trains in which in every highway entrance there would be a dedicated lane/railway for vehicles to travel at fast speeds like trains. This would reduce traffic and travel times."
1859,3,328,['car'],company that comes in the early morning and scraps and snow/ice off my car

1870,3,328,['car'],Everything runs on automated self driving cars.  Normal cars are not allowed on the road.  Everything will run smoothly since it is computer operated and parking spaces won't be needed.  Bicyclists will no longer have to worry.
1871,3,328,['car'],Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
1872,3,328,['car'],extremely light rail. People hop into 1 person rail cars that take up less room than a bike lane. There would be no waiting at the rail station because it leaves as soon as you get in.
1873,3,328,['car'],Flying taxi cars?
1874,3,328,['car'],"flying transportation system will be very famous in future for example flying car, flying scatter board bike and so"
1875,3,328,['car'],"For transportation in my neighborhood we have cars, and buses. The most popular mode of transportation being the four door family sedan type car.

1877,3,328,['car'],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
1878,3,328,['car'],Future transportation in my neighborhood would be by air. Cars will travel in the air and park on top of roof buildings. Gas would not cost that much and it will be less crowed on the streets.

1880,3,328,['car'],"Have a business where drivers rent cars, for hours and not days. The cars can be electric cars. Make them the cheapest cars possible. Make it for around the metro area only - and have the credit card swiper built into the car itself. In other words If you rent three hours with the car, it goes dead until you pay for more time. If someone takes it out of the pre-defined boundaries  of the city the car goes dead. You would have these little rental kiosks set up all over the city."
1881,3,328,['car'],Have a monorail system around town. It'll reduce pollution because people will have fun using it instead of driving their cars.
1882,3,328,['car'],Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city.

1887,3,328,['car'],Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.
1888,3,328,['car'],"How about color coded cars that only service a particular area for a flat rate. As the car takes a passenger to desired location within that particular area, if another person flags that same colored car, that person can hop in and share the ride. After all, the drop off points will be in the same general area and the rate is flat."

1892,3,328,['car'],"I could imagine single rider tram cars. The cars would be tethered to cables above the streets. Something akin to ski lift carriage, but completely enclosed in glass. Advantage would be thy could run off electric current and would reduce ground street traffic"
1893,3,328,['car'],"I don't anticipate the transportation system changing too much in my area no matter the time frame. I think the car will rule for the next several decades, but I would like the cars to change. They need not be so huge, and would be powered by plug-in type electrical engines. Each home would have a solar array and this would power your home, and your car. A back-up natural gas power plant would help out if it's cloudy for weeks. Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
1894,3,328,['car'],"I feel that in the future there will be futuristic cars that will slowly evolve away from gasoline use more natural resources for fuel.  I think that the cars will continue to evolve into more sustainable, aerodynamic shapes and designs."
1895,3,328,['car'],"I get out of my house and before I leave my apartment on my 12th floor I just press a button on my app on my phone to type a location of the place i need to go.This would in turn contact all local data base systems of GPS based transport systems irrespective of the vendors available or government supported transport systems which include Cabs,Buses,Trains,Subway,3 Wheelers and most importantly assuming the people of the future will care a lot more about the environment and all the people who are going alone in a 5 seater car would have a option of sharing there carbon footprint left by the vehicle.And if the co-ordinates of the person with the car and the co-ordinates of the Person who is using the app matches then a Random Unique (one time use)Number or Picture or Anything which would be visible from atleast 10 feet away on a Min 6 inch screen.However this interface can be avoided by tracking the dots on the GPS system or by sending a snap shot of the car number or a photo of the person himself which will be destroyed automatically by the system once the person is down from the Vehicle.Punch Line Before I get to the main gates of the apartment.I should have the list of Vehicles available to me and the time it would take the vehicle to reach my place based on GPS and traffic conditions and also how much time would it take to reach my destination again based on real time traffic conditions and also most importantly.if i take  the public transport system.How much time would it take to reach the same destination and also how much Carbon foot print would i save from doing it.And also the time required by the vehicle to reach the local transport systems if it is not a walkable distance.There are many more ,But i think that is enough for the day.

GIVE THE CUSTOMER ALL THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS OF COMMUTING WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE COST AND THE TIME INVOLVED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VENDOR OR GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS..."
1896,3,328,['car'],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
1897,3,328,['car'],"I imagine a series of widening arches or loops of roadway and of several different sizes to accompany different types of pubic transport. Cars wouldn't be allowed in the city but stored at various exit point garages which would be provided by the city. Small roads would have small shuttles, large roads would have large fast moving shuttles that span the city. Independently, smaller walkways would be used for pedestrians and cyclists (and other man powered or tiny engine machines.) Larger walkways could become festival street fair type roads that are common in places like Greece."
1898,3,328,['car'],I imagine a type of highway for bicycles where people can use on and off ramps easily to reach their destination. They wont have to worry about cars since its a bike only highway system. it will get people to their destination quicker since they dont have to stop at traffic lights and watch out for pedestrians.
1899,3,328,['car'],I imagine a type of hybrid car/rail system that are not owned by individuals.  A person would schedule a pickup to go to work and one home.  The cars would keep circulating picking up and dropping off people all day.  There would be much lesser need for personal parking as well.
1900,3,328,['car'],I imagine that instead of transporting with cars we could turn all the roads in our neighborhood into rivers and use boats to get to places.
1901,3,328,['car'],"I live in a chicago suburb and I believe that driverless cars are the future.  But what I actually prefer is everyone driving their own vehicle, what i actually hope happens in the future is that licenses are much harder to get...there are so many people out there with no clue of the rules of the road and it is hazardous to everyone around them."
1902,3,328,['car'],"I live in a neighborhood near an excellent metro system, but not walkable to it. I would like a people-mover sort of system that travels through the neighborhood making the existing metro station more accessible. Perhaps small cars or pods at the end of each street that travel along an elevated rail directly to the metro station."
1903,3,328,['car'],"I live in a rural area so horseback travel, hay wagon travel and buckboard travel may well be decent substitutes for cars and buses presently being used."
1904,3,328,['car'],I live in a rural community about 1 hour from a city. I would like to see this area build a light rail commuter line that could link these isolated communities and boost the economy. Many people out here do not even have cars.
1905,3,328,['car'],"I live in a small village.  Everything is close together, so it might be possible to have a bicycle share program.  Bicycles could be borrowed and then returned to the same place or a different place.  This would allow people to get around without using cars."
1906,3,328,['car'],"I live in a snowy climate, so there are a lot of times that we can't drive our cars anywhere because of all the snow. So a snowmobile taxi might work."
1907,3,328,['car'],"I live in a very hilly neighborhood. I suggest a funicular! A funicular is a railway built on a steep hill with tram cars for transport. Put it on one of the hills in the center of the neighborhood. People would be only a short walk (less than 10 minutes), hop on the funicular and it could take them to the church, the school and the neighborhood business district. Bam. No more worrying about going up and down the crazy hills, especially in the winter. Booyah!"
1908,3,328,['car'],I live in an area where horses are abundant. It would be a trip if everyone started using their horse instead of a car or motorcycle.
1909,3,328,['car'],"i live in twin falls idaho and we could use a bus line, i guess it isn't a new idea  but yeah this is a place where there is sharp economic divide and all the businesses are on the rich side of town, the original town or the poor side of town ""old town"" is roughly a mile from the main drag so buses would be great for people who cant afford cars and better for the environment in general"
1910,3,328,['car'],"I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
1911,3,328,['car'],"I picture a brand new train system, going down the main street, with street cars going leading up to the main street.   I would love to see it being a high speed system, paying with your fingerprints.   It would be similar to a credit card."
1912,3,328,['car'],I picture a streamlined 'box' like a cable car that is hanging from a line or track throughout the city. It would be shaped like a rectangle with smooth edges and very compact and sleak. It glides up to the booth where people may get on and each cable car 'box' can hold 6 people in 3 rows of 2 with a small walking aisle to the side.
1913,3,328,['car'],I propose an idea that would rely on strong wire much like telephone wire that would be used to support a small train carriage like car or pod.  I see this as being better than a railway as it would be not as expensive to implement.
1914,3,328,['car'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
1915,3,328,['car'],"I see the potential for self-driving cars to replace taxi services. People would call an automated line, or perhaps interact with a site/app on their computers/phones, to schedule to be picked up by the service. Meanwhile, a network that keeps track of all self-driving cars in its region would figure out which car was closest or would have to deviate the least to pick up the passenger within 5-10 minutes of being hailed. These cars could be compartmentalized to hold four or six passengers without individuals having to worry about undesired contact with the other passengers. The cars could run on electricity and the network would consider battery life with regards to planning routes and destinations."
1916,3,328,['car'],"I think a good idea will be to use electric cycles instead of a bike or a car in metros. They not only help in decreasing pollution as well as motivating people towards physical exercises.



A proper network of e cycles and connected to a main frame can be seen as a new transportation system emerging. Moreover this can also be used as a public transportation system by constructing cycle stands where they can be charged and the cost of public transport can be paid in the machine."
1917,3,328,['car'],"I think a good idea will be to use electric cycles instead of a bike or a car in metros. They not only help in decreasing pollution as well as motivating people towards physical exercises.

1919,3,328,['car'],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
1920,3,328,['car'],"I think a great idea within my neighborhood would basically to have a moving sidewalk like you would find at an airport.  This would allow people to move about faster than maybe they would walking, so people wouldn't feel the need to get in the car to go down the block to the store."
1921,3,328,['car'],I think a monorail system or cable cars like you see on ski lifts would be quite useful. moving walkways enclosed in a plastic tunnel to protect from elements that would have heat or a/c depending on the season would be really cool as well.
1922,3,328,['car'],"I think automated cars that work like taxis would be great.  They would have short range ones and long ranges ones.  Also, larger ones that go on busy commute routes each day to and from work.  With them being automated everything would be faster and run more efficiently."
1923,3,328,['car'],"I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it. I don't think that vehicle ownership will be nearly as widespread as it is these days, as driverless cars will be far safer."
1924,3,328,['car'],"I think for small towns like mine (20,000) we should have a cross between a trolley and a hoverboard. If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
1925,3,328,['car'],I think if we had automatic cars that you could order from your smart phone when you wanted it.
1926,3,328,['car'],"I think teleportation would be awesome. Wouldn't need cars anymore, save on oil and fumes in the environment. People would be happier because they wouldn't be stuck in traffic or have to drive hours to see long distance family members."
1927,3,328,['car'],I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.
1928,3,328,['car'],I think that community cars that attribute to car pooling would be wonderful.
1929,3,328,['car'],"I think that some sort of charging commuter car should be parked in every neighborhood. People could coordinate commute times and use electric cars instead of gas, in exchange they pay $1 a day to drive the car per person."
1930,3,328,['car'],I think that there should be a way to get bugs off a windshield without harming the paint job on a car.  It should be a spray while you are driving much like windshield wiper fluid
1931,3,328,['car'],"I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
1932,3,328,['car'],"I think we need to tap into the power of magnets.  We can use solar panels all through the roads, then use them to power magnets on the road.  The vehicles will have oppositely polarized magnets that will be controllable in the car.  I guess it will work like those trains that use magnets, but someone smart will figure out a way to control the magnets independently.  The car battery will power the magnet on the car, and can be shut off immediately once the power is cut in case of emergency."
1933,3,328,['car'],I think we should have more and cheaper car sharing.  And use electric cars.
1934,3,328,['car'],"I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
1935,3,328,['car'],I visualize a car ride sharing phone application in which people put in the destination that they want to go to and they can connect with people going that same direction for a ride.
1936,3,328,['car'],"I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
1937,3,328,['car'],"I wish we had separate bicycle highways that were enclosed spaces, both heated and cooled for summer/winter. It would be a cheaper mode of transportation. There would be protection to prevent car vs bicycle accident, a major problem in our area. It would also be healthier and exercise for the day during a commute. I picture it being a rounded space that is clear so you can see your surroundings outside."
1938,3,328,['car'],"I would imagine a combination of Uber and self-driving cars. I can imagine a world where I don't own a car. Instead, I click a button on an app on my phone, and an automated car shows up shortly after, taking me wherever I need to go."
1939,3,328,['car'],I would imagine a street car type system that would connect each neighborhood.
1940,3,328,['car'],"I would like a car that can maneuver around slow people and even change shape when theres little room to maneuver, so I can get to work on time!"
1941,3,328,['car'],"I would like a free car sharing service.  So the city provides cars, but that can only be used if they are full, so that you have an incentive to carpool, and as long as you do, you get a free ride."
1942,3,328,['car'],I would like to see a cable car that runs across the city.  It would take people across the busy streets.  It would be convenient for office workers. It would cut down on traffic in the downtown area.
1943,3,328,['car'],"I would like to see a People Mover connecting Trenton, Southgate, Taylor and Wyandotte. There seems to be a lot of people walking down streets such as Trenton and Eureka, and especially so in the winter. I can envision a rail system supported by local tax dollars very similar to the one to the north in Detroit. People around here are constantly complaining about weather conditions and global warming and I think my method could bring a lot of people together and solve a lot of the commuting problems around here. There are just so many cars and it seems there is an average of just 1.5 people per vehicle. It is rather said. I really would want to push toward the people mover rail systems."
1944,3,328,['car'],"I would like to see a public transportation system, funded by the government and running non-stop.  Possibly employing people in an uber style privately owned vehicle service.  Or some car pool ideas."
1945,3,328,['car'],"I would like to see a short-term car rental service with semi-autonomous driving. For example, if I needed to go to the airport and didn't want to leave my current car in a parking lot their I could rent a car that I could summon with a smartphone app. The car would be able autonomously drive directly to me or a location I choose through the app. After I was at the location of my choosing and no longer needed the car, I could then use the app to send the car away."
1946,3,328,['car'],"I would like to see a system built around ""people movers"" - similar to the ride that was once at Disneyland.  It would run underneath the ground - under the traffic.  Each car would hold one or two people with large reclining chairs and a docking station for your laptop so you can watch movies, play games or actually do work."
1947,3,328,['car'],"I would like to see all self driving cars, driving at top speeds because human error and crashes have been removed from the equation. So everyone can get to their destination five, maybe ten times as fast, without a significant infrastructure overhaul."
1948,3,328,['car'],"I would like to see an advanced transportation system that involved driverless cars.  The idea is the same as using a taxi but without a driver.  Like Uber, you would use your mobile device to order a car and control the experience.  The car shows up at your door, takes you to your destination and you are billed for the ride. It would save me thousands of dollars in the cost to own, maintain, insure and license my own personal car."
1949,3,328,['car'],"I would like to see lightrail or street cars inbny neighbor hood.   Something that was powered in part by alternative energy.  Solar panels on the stations, perhaps on top of the light rail cars."
1950,3,328,['car'],I would love if my neighborhood had a rail system that worked from magnets and floated along the rail at high speeds.  I wish that the cars were individual and that I could get in and select from a list of destinations.  I would like my own car and to be able to bring my dogs with me.  It would be fast and smooth and work with minimal power.
1951,3,328,['car'],"I would love to see some kind of computer-operated taxi service in my city. The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
1952,3,328,['car'],I would love to see the use of self propelled equipment like hover boards and such used to help decrease emissions from cars. Highways and roads could be established just for such travelors. and we would also save money on gas
1953,3,328,['car'],I would rent golf carts in the summer to the elderly without cars so they could shop.
1954,3,328,['car'],"I would suggest public car rentals funded monthly, with constant access."
1955,3,328,['car'],I would think a fleet of hovercraft would be amazing.  They wouldnt damage roads like cars and would allow people to get around with a minimum usage of energy.
1956,3,328,['car'],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
1957,3,328,['car'],I'd like to see some sort of autonomous shared fleet of cars that are fueled in some sort of environmentally friendly way. Solar panels on the roof? Maybe bike pedaling inside if you want to exercise and provide a small amount of power? I feel like autonomous cars alone will save a ton of energy just by eliminating traffic jams. And cut down on wind resistance since you wouldn't need to keep the traditional design necessarily.
1958,3,328,['car'],"I'd like to see vehicles that will fly, take up little space on the ground, go up and down more like a helicopter so large parking runways are not needed. These cars would almost fly themselves and need little direction other than where they're going."
1959,3,328,['car'],"I'd love to see a crowdsourced method of alternate transportation in my city, where people could request rides from others who happen to be in the area and going the direction you need to with a minimal cost. There are so many people who have cars and it would be a great option for people who don't have reliable access to one. It could use cell phone apps and perhaps even have a traditional component using telephone for people who are less technologically inclined. The biggest challenge would be safety/security, and I'm honestly not sure how to overcome that aspect. There could be specific stops, almost like bus stops, where people could gather and wait for rides, or schedule rides to pick them up at certain times."
1960,3,328,['car'],"I'd use apps and social media so I know the times of all transport.  If it's late, I don't want to hang out too long. An app would pick up my location and show the times of the buses or street car. I could set it to warn me too."
1961,3,328,['car'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
1962,3,328,['car'],"If we could be so technologically advanced to create giant versions of the airport conveyor belts where humans are carried across, that would be my new method of transportation. Since people are mostly lazy and want something to do the work for them (hence the upcoming popularity of the hands-free segway), this would be perfect to eliminate at least a fourth of the traffic on the street from cars."
1963,3,328,['car'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
1964,3,328,['car'],"In my city, it is almost impossible to not having a car since the public transportation is not that good. However, car ownership can be quite expensive. Car sharing could reduce the cost of having a car, we can build a system that anyone can use a ""public"" car that can be shared after paying a certain fixed cost up-front and hourly/daily rate afterward."
1965,3,328,['car'],"In the downtown area, stations to rent bicycles or even mopeds. Maybe you could have a really cheap membership and present your card at the check out station. Then you would return it at another check out station. It would cut down on how much people use cars. The key would be having enough stations to actually get the bike or moped to make the idea viable."
1966,3,328,['car'],"In the interest of reducing traffic and accidents, a new series of self-driving only roads and lanes are opened.  On these roads, ONLY self driving cars are authorized to drive, and on them there are no speed limits (not that the self-driving cars would be going that much faster than normal). Unfettered by the chaos of common roads and the limitations of human judgement, these exclusively self-driving vehicle areas allow the navigational AIs to coordinate for an optimally fast and efficient journey."
1967,3,328,['car'],"In times of heavy snow, why not have cross country ski rentals?  It would be a lot of fun to be out and about on skis.  People could easily learn and have lessons.  People complain all the time they can't get their cars out after a storm.  Well, why not rent some skis and go to the grocery store that way for your bread and milk?  It would be very effective and wonderful exercise."
1968,3,328,['car'],Individual cars on a track that you can program to take you where you want without having to drive.
1969,3,328,['car'],"Invest tax money into developing solar powered cars, this will reduce pollution along with reducing reliance on oil. Give citizens some kind of incentive to buy these cars and turn in their old gas-powered cars."
1970,3,328,['car'],"It would be a railway but instead of a train, it has small, separate cars that only fit one individual for their own convenience and comfort. The car would be a tall, rectangular box shape with a seat, kind of like a car seat inside."
1971,3,328,['car'],It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
1972,3,328,['car'],It would be cool (although pretty difficult to actually create) to have a gondola lift public transportation system that had cars that could travel over the streets and take people places avoiding traffic! There'd be stops that had elevators and stairs to get up to them and basically they'd just be suspended a bit above the streets and you could travel nicely between them over all the traffic below.
1973,3,328,['car'],"It would be great if we could improve the pubic transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road. I would like to see self driving buses as well as bus only lanes and self driving cars. No manually controlled cars would be allowed and because of this hopefully the roads will be safer because most accidents and caused by human error. We could have the speed limits increased as well because self driving cars can ""see"" a lot father ahead than humans."
1974,3,328,['car'],It would be like a super fast tram or train so the people in my neighborhood could get to run errands without their cars. We could have stops at the entrances to the neighborhood and the tracks could just run down the street.
1975,3,328,['car'],"It would be small individual electric golf cart-like cars that run along the edge of the sidewalks every couple of minutes that people can hop into to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, post office, etc.  they operate from out of a common neighborhood ""hub"" so each system covers a small area.  People can just call one from an app on their smart phone, they are charged a small fee, then after the trip, the cart remains in one area until it is called again or it returns to the hub to be charged."
1976,3,328,['car'],"It would have to be something that is a hybrid that helps the environment where when you get into it it's propelled by recycled human waste.   I know it sounds a little weird but if you realize how much of it there is it would be awesome to get the benefits of those of a botanist in outer space for instance like in the movie ""The Marsian"" and apply it to car transportation."
1977,3,328,['car'],"It would replace everything: roads, sideways, buses, etc. It would be electric powered. Definitely automated. You should be able to transport to wherever you want to go without lifting a finger. Since it would replace sidewalks, you can simple stand on it and it would move you from one place to another, like a conveyor belt. It would be financed by monthly subscription, with VIP access for a higher price you can travel on the road with automatic cars that would operate in similar fashion."
1978,3,328,['car'],It's an elevated covered roadway somewhat similar to elevated train tracks but it's for bicycles and it has a bunch of fans to provide an artificial tailwind to provide a speed comparable to cars in a congested urban setting.
1979,3,328,['car'],"Larger Vehicles for apps like Uber that set up car pool for large amounts of people that are going to the same area. For example in Austin, Texas many people enjoy 6th straight but struggle to find parking. If apps like uber could set up their own busses or larger vehicles for transportation to places like 6th street or concerts/ sports arenas it would be much more efficient than a bus that makes regular stops."
1980,3,328,['car'],"Luxury busses, nicer busses for people who don't want to own a car but want nicer transportation than what you get from a public bus experience"
1981,3,328,['car'],"Make hovercars to get people around.  There is a guy in Canada that actually made a hover car, so it would be great if you could move that idea over to a car.  Make them solar powered so they are kinder to the environment."
1982,3,328,['car'],"Mass transit only routes that expedite buses, bikes and High occupancy vehicles on smaller , yet more direct routes. Toll type control and monitoring. Make a single person in s single car very difficult and punitive"
1983,3,328,['car'],maybe a flying car to avoid traffic
1984,3,328,['car'],"Maybe a neighborhood car service where people pitch in a certain amount per month, and then they can order a car to drive them anywhere in the neighborhood that they need to go to"
1985,3,328,['car'],"Might as well offer mass transit that also includes dining services in the bus, in addition to completely free wifi.  Could also offer services to wash cars at the pick up site, so that when you get to your car in the evening it's already clean"
1986,3,328,['car'],"most of the people are going office by car . In rainy season if you go by car that is not problem.but scooter using people and children are affected by rain . for that if we fix wind resistant ,water resistant umbrella in the bike . In the handle bar that will be very useful for two wheelers .If we make that kind of vehicle that will become very successful .because of rain only most of the people will go by car . or else they will go by scooter. that will reduce the traffic jam."
1987,3,328,['car'],"My city is a little small and close together. Most people use a car or the bus. I think it would be a great idea if more people rode bicycles, and I don't think it would take much longer to get where they need to go."
1988,3,328,['car'],My city is currently looking at High Occupancy Travel toll lanes.  I've thought that a dedicated lane for buses or van pools would be an alternative that could let the car commuters see the speed at which these other options can get to work.  This would encourage the use of the bus / van pool options.
1989,3,328,['car'],My idea is a car application that notifies you when you get in about the weather and road conditions.
1990,3,328,['car'],"My idea is a combination of self driving cars, rideshare and a train. Commuters would pay for a ticket and a line of connected self driving cars would take commuters going the same route/direction to a certain dropoff point, like a train does. Then when the string of cars reaches the stop point, each passenger can enter their desired destination into the touchpad screen in the car and they would be driven to their individual destinations. The self driving cars would break off individually from the train to take these passengers, then they'd return on their own to the ""train station"" to go pick up more passengers."
1991,3,328,['car'],My idea is a telephone that automatically locks itself down so that when you are in transport via car or any other mode of transportation it cannot be used until it detects you are no longer in transport.
1992,3,328,['car'],"My idea is electric cars that can recharge via solar and other renewable options, such that it never has to be plugged in and will always have sufficient charge.  I acknowledge technology has not reached this point of efficiency yet, but one day."
1993,3,328,['car'],"My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."
1994,3,328,['car'],"My idea is re-creating the Trolly car, they would go through neighborhoods and people can hop on and off as it slowly moves."
1995,3,328,['car'],My idea is to have a service like zipcar in which someone rents the use of a car by paying a monthly fee except that it would be mopeds for individuals or something larger like a pick up truck.  Just more options than a small smart car.  I used to live in Tokyo and driving a car there was awful but not something like a moped or motorcycle because they could ride in between the cars.  A larger vehicle like a pickup truck would be good for people who need to rent something to haul furniture or something like that but don't want to drive all the way to a car rental place or Lowe's to get the truck.  Everything would be rentable using an app and the cars would feature opening the doors and starting the cars through the app itself.
1996,3,328,['car'],"My mode of alternative transportation would include cars, buses, and trams running on solar energy in roadways. I'm unsure how it would work exactly, but if we could harness the power of the sun and build vehicles that have the panels either on them or in the tires it could remove the use of fossil fuels."
1997,3,328,['car'],"My mom had this silly idea the other day when we were sitting in traffic. Cars that change shape depending on however many people were in it. Say, two people? It'd transform into a smartcar size. One person? Tiny one-person cubicle machine. Sure, it's not really feasible - but it's interesting. It'd make traffic feel less terrible if we could see how many people are in said car and how fast they'd be crossing streets and so on. Maybe have a designated lane for however many people?"
1998,3,328,['car'],"My neighborhood currently has no bike lanes, so I would imagine a system with renewable transportation integrated into the layout. Spaces for bikes, electric car re-charging stations, etc."
1999,3,328,['car'],"My neighborhood filled with uber drives. However, there is no cost assoicated with the transit it is all provided by the town. It would be like new york city (think of cabs), however nice black cars everywhere and someone can hop in to any one they want free of charge. Baisically be like public transit with uber and they will take you wherever you want."
2000,3,328,['car'],"my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops. People will be able to travel to any part of the world without going through airports and flight connections. There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
2001,3,328,['car'],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
2002,3,328,['car'],My neighborhood needs a car share system between individuals. It would be similar to Uber but you would be able to drive someone else's car for a monthly fee.
2003,3,328,['car'],"My town is in desparate need of a form of public transportation. Everyone is reliant on a car or scooter. I think they don't have enough need to  warrant a bus route, but I'm in favor of widening the tiny bicycle lanes they have."
2004,3,328,['car'],My transportation idea would be using technology to make car sharing more accessible. Such as a phone application. It would be cheaper than using lyft or uber.
2005,3,328,['car'],"My transportation system would be for people to enter their own personal, flying car. The destination would be put into the onboard computer. And then the flying car would automatically proceed on the matrix."
2006,3,328,['car'],"New idea, trains that fly.  This would combine two existing means of transportation into one futuristic flight fantasy! A train would travel as usual and then be picked up by a plane.  This way a train car could travel faster and then be dropped back off on its final stop by the plane."
2007,3,328,['car'],Now Houston already have public bike stations. These stations allow someone to check out a bike for the day for a small fee. In some other cities someone has the choice to rent a car for the day using a credit card . The cars are eco friendly and cost very little to rent. I'm not talking about CarMax. This service is similar to the same service that is offered to rent bikes here in Houston. I think Houston should think about bringing the idea to the city .
2008,3,328,['car'],Obviously self driving cars are going to be the norm in 10 years.  It's basically just a standard vehicle with additional software and mechanical components that let it interact with the road and other vehicles without user input.  You'll be able to just hop in and be taken to wherever you need to go that has a road to it while you relax.
2009,3,328,['car'],"One day per month (at least) cars should be banned from the roads. Some buses could be allowed to allow for transportation of people who can't walk or bike, but this would be a great way to encourage human-powered transport and allow people to see the fun in this activity without increased danger from car traffic.  This would also be great for the environment."
2010,3,328,['car'],"One person cars. That's right. A one seated car that allows one individual to have complete control. What is this solving you may ask. Why create a bigger vehicle for and individuals who has no use for it. Just a one door car that has a seat, a gear shift and a steering wheel. There are still creature comforts that are compact and accessible for each individual. Best part, they are one fifth of the price."
2011,3,328,['car'],"Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."
2012,3,328,['car'],"People could ride bicycles to work, it would help as it would be good exercise. It could also be fun to do something different, as most others drives cars or trucks. However it could only for for close workplaces, as a lot of work is further then in bicycling distance."
2013,3,328,['car'],People step into a box which is like an elevator. It zooms around the streets taking you where you want to go. it runs on a track runs in the street. The track is a small groove in the street that isn't disruptive and allows cars to continue to travel on the road.
2014,3,328,['car'],Perhaps a system where you can rent out bicycles or motorbikes to get to where you need to go. You could hold a lot of them in one area and make it easy to check out the bike and then return it later. It would help getting around for people who can't afford a car service to take them around the city but also for people who prefer to be health conscious and also want to save money by biking around the city.

2046,3,328,['car'],"The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
2047,3,328,['car'],The future of transportation in my city is by having self-automated driverless cars. They would reduce the amount of traffic congestion and reduce the number of car accidents.
2048,3,328,['car'],"The future transportation system in my neighborhood is called air cars. They were created in an effort to reduce carbon footprints and try to save our planet. These vehicles are much more lighter than regular cars and can be upgraded to fly. The best thing about these cars is that they operate solely on air. What is even better is that there is a filter that intakes air and cleans it by trapping dirty air in a compartment only able to be removed by manufacturers. This is our last ditch effort to save the Earth, so buy a Clean Car."
2049,3,328,['car'],The idea of having only driverless cars. No one will own a car. You just send a message through a driverless car app. The car closest to you will come pick you up. The cars will also have the ability to carpool (picking up people going in the same direction). The cars should also have the ability to go to a gas station on their own.

2052,3,328,['car'],The system will be based off cable cars.  It's cheaper and easier to put up than bridges or building tunnels.  They will have their own traffic free paths.  The paths can even intersect by having the cables much higher than the other line's.  There can be platforms every so often so people can get on and off but not too many as to keep cost and commute time down.
2053,3,328,['car'],"The transportation system in my neighborhood consists of each person driving their own cars. Occasionally, people will carpool, but there is no public transportation and walking is not feasable."
2054,3,328,['car'],The transportation system would be a combination of roads with cars and a railroad track. All of the cars would be connected and be able to drive themselves. Cars would all be on tracks and controlled by the car itself. This would lower accidents and allow for better traffic. Cars would be able to accelerate much faster as there is no driver intervention and you don't have to wait for other cars to accelerate or worry about where other cars are going.
2055,3,328,['car'],The van cars can be used as a means of transport for dropping people at scheduled times just like buses. They will have limited stops to minimize wait time and people using cars for nearby locations can use it instead of using cars personally or waiting for bus at bus stops which go stopping at all the bus stops.
2056,3,328,['car'],There are a lot of fairly narrow paths in between buildings in my area. It would be good if they could be paved smoother to be used by bicyclists. It would make their travel more efficient and would also increase their safety as they wouldn't have to spend as much time on roads meant for cars.
2057,3,328,['car'],There are two different modes of transportation within my city. The first one is a car. They usually have four doors on the left and right sides of them that open outwardly. There are four wheels and windows towards the top of the vehicle for viewing. The steering gear is located in the front seat on the left hand side and is controlled by the driver.
2058,3,328,['car'],There is no bus system so my idea is for a bus system in my area.  I live in a suburbs of a small town and there is no bus out here.  It would be nice to have one.  Sometimes I don't have access to a car and maybe this bus could help me get to the store or church.  I would also like the bus system to be able to take me to the small town to go shopping and stuff.
2059,3,328,['car'],"There should be a completely separate bike lane that runs throughout the city, and is plowed even during the winter.

2063,3,328,['car'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
2064,3,328,['car'],"This is a transportation system that delivers food directly to people's houses.

2084,3,328,['car'],"We will have cars that can lift off the ground and ""fly"" with a air propel system. This would be fast enough for them to travel in that city area without hitting any others."
2085,3,328,['car'],"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."
2086,3,328,['car'],"Car sharing. Everyone can join a club which has some monthly fee, let's say $100. If they pay this, then they find someone who lets them ride everyday with them to work and back home. They driver gets most of the money (the rest goes to overhead) and takes them to and from work everyday. So I guess it's like a taxi service with a monthly fee, hopefully that using people that work with you at your job."
2087,3,328,['car'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
2088,3,328,['car'],"Telepads! The Transportation of the Future! Simply step on this portal pad, and you are instantly transported to your location! The movement of molecules into energy is completely safe, and many users only experience a minor burning sensation for a minute after the teleportation process. Forget flying cars, late trains or other outdated modes of transport, and tele away with Telepads!"
2089,4,265,['city'],"A bicycle rental system that allows town-owned bicycles to be ""checked out"" at various locations throughout the city, and returned to any of several locations. This will encourage people to ride bikes, even if they do not own them themselves."
2090,4,265,['city'],"A bike rental service that lest customers rent bikes for reasonable rates daily or weekly, with pick up and return spots very conveniently located around the city"
2091,4,265,['city'],"A Bus system, within the metro area that was funded by a tax on gas purchased by individual commuters. In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."
2092,4,265,['city'],"A central hub for a ridesharing service that provides cars for small groups to take to neighboring towns. I live in a rural area, a few minutes from a very small village. The nearest SMALL city is about 30 minutes away, and the nearest decent sized city is almost an hour away. A ridesharing service would make accessing these places much easier, and if the company provided the car (for a fee, of course), those without vehicles could be serviced."
2093,4,265,['city'],"A circulatory bus system consisting of two vehicle traveling in opposite directions on a set route but with no designated stops. The route in my small district of the city takes approximately 20 minutes to to circumnavigate and consists of goth commercial districts. One would never be more than 10 minutes fro being able to hail the ""jitney"" bus. This alleviates the use of regular bus system which is much more focused on funneling clientele to central city and runs more or less eradicately.It envisions using current tech and is human centered. It is innovative in it's goals not hardware."
2094,4,265,['city'],A city bus that has entertainment in it like movies and music
2095,4,265,['city'],"A concept similar to Uber, but with a bus. Especially in a city the socialization factor of riding with other passengers while going to a destination could be nice. You would be able to specifically request stops and pickups."
2096,4,265,['city'],A covered moving sidewalk that allows you to walk on it as well so you get to where you need but also get exercise. It would run throughout the city.
2097,4,265,['city'],A crowd-sourced bus stop app. Instead of having fixed bus stops throughout the city. People through a smart phone app request a bus to stop at a certain locations. This would provide information to the bus service company in improving the locations and times of where service is needed the most.
2098,4,265,['city'],A giant water slide that takes you from tower to tower in a city
2099,4,265,['city'],A high speed conveyor belt that travels through peoples' houses that can take people to city centers.
2100,4,265,['city'],A high speed monorail system that winds its way through all the important points of interest in the city. It would look futuristic and high tech with a sophisticated level of design along with being reliable.
2101,4,265,['city'],A high speed train/subway that links all the cities in the Detroit metro area.
2102,4,265,['city'],A high-speed rail that goes around the neighborhood into the city.
2103,4,265,['city'],"A light rail from city center to neighboring suburbs that would replace thousands of commuters and make rush hours less crowded and stressful. This could be as simple as one station in each suburb (thus 10-15 total stations), or a more complex system with multiple stations in each suburb."
2104,4,265,['city'],"A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.  They would park their cars before entering the city, and use this quick system for getting around.  No more crowded, expensive parking in the city."
2105,4,265,['city'],A motorized scooter program where  you can rent them from stations throughout the city.
2106,4,265,['city'],"A mutli-layed monorail system that is solar and wind powered. I leave in las vegas, which has a centralized population. It would go up and down the strip and between the strip and downtown and around the city."
2107,4,265,['city'],A network of publicly available electric cars will drive around the city in the most efficient manner possible. People will use apps to call a car to get them =from one of many pickup spots and drop them off before they go on the next passenger.
2108,4,265,['city'],A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
2109,4,265,['city'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
2110,4,265,['city'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
2111,4,265,['city'],"A new transportation system uses solar panel on the roads to empower vehicles to travel around the city. As vehicles get on the road, it automatically connects on the server of the roads and energies stored on boxes on street corners come one. These vehicles do not use gasoline, ethanol or diesel. It is greenhouse and uses electricity collected from the sun. Renewable energy that saves money and free to the entire residents meaning as long as the sun still shines, vehicles will work."
2112,4,265,['city'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
2113,4,265,['city'],"a new vehicle given to everyone that works in the city, and the vehicle is super small and runs on batteries."
2114,4,265,['city'],A new way to transport in my neighborhood? I would honestly say cabs. They are not around where I live. But a cheaper way and only in the city. It's mostly just busses and the stops are few and far between.
2115,4,265,['city'],"A person's place of employment, such as a hospital could conceivably shuttle employees from home to work via a small bus. The city or county could be divided into quadrants to further facilitate timely pickups. This would definitely free up traffic if the workplace had 9000+ employees."
2116,4,265,['city'],A public taxi system dedicated to public transportation.  Standard operating hours and funded through taxes.  On demand pick up via city based app.  Essentially eliminating everyday drivers.
2117,4,265,['city'],A rail system that goes from the outlying suburbs to the big city.
2118,4,265,['city'],a railway system that goes over parts of the city and is solar powered so its more efficient.
2119,4,265,['city'],A smart electric trolley hybrid system that is integrated with the current roadway network. The electric power for the network is generated by turbines in the city water supply.
2120,4,265,['city'],"A sort of rail line, but it's a single rail and has many hanging carts. The carts hold maybe 4 people at a time, like a taxi. The price would be cheaper than a bus and they would arrive quickly when you need them. You could push a button on poles that are located around the city, far more often than bus stops, and the cart will come to you quickly and take you directly to your destination. No need for bus drivers or waiting for traffic!"
2121,4,265,['city'],A station with a tube in the ground with a high speed pod that would shoot me at a quick speed across the city or across the country in a couple hours. It would be faster than an airplane and safer too.
2122,4,265,['city'],"A subway system in my city is badly needed. We have terrible traffic and everything in the city is built in a grid system. It would save time, money and gas consumption for millions."
2123,4,265,['city'],"a subway type system that would have personal cars for people.  after typing in your destination, the car you were in would choose the quickest route within the city system of tracks permitted to get you to your destination. futuristic."
2124,4,265,['city'],A system where cars are left with the keys in them but they require a passcode to unlock that is only obtained by renting the car. It can then be parked in special spots around the city for the next person to use.
2125,4,265,['city'],A train that connects Orlando and Tampa for easier travel for better job opportunities for both cities
2126,4,265,['city'],"A train would be useful in my city. It would be most useful to travel out to other nearby cities. Traffic is extremely bad on the interstate where I live, and a train would be incredibly useful for traveling to the popular cities surrounding my city."
2127,4,265,['city'],"A walking pathway across every rooftop in the city.   It would cut down on danger from cars, and it'd be fun to see the scenery.  This could easily be constructed with some good, sturdy planks.  Line them up on the roof, screw them in or hammer them in.  Every building would have a fire escape on it for easy access back to the street.  This would save much time as you could go ""as the eagle flies."" straight across the roofs."
2128,4,265,['city'],"Although nationwide there has been a rise in alternative fuel sources, there is absolutely no support for that in my city. I think there should be an alternative fueling station installed to get people interested in adopting these technologies, and to show local support for the progressive idea."
2129,4,265,['city'],"An alternative transport that would be excellent would be a monorail in my city.  It could be run with electricity, with many train cars, and go along the main north south route.  You could get almost anywhere in quickly and easily if it went along that route."
2130,4,265,['city'],"An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
2131,4,265,['city'],"An app based method of ride sharing public transit. City drivers in fuel efficient vans would respond to requested pick ups. The pick up requested by a rider would be assigned a pick up time within a short variable of the requested pick up (say 30 minutes), the van will pick up multiple parties near each other and drop them off at their destinations similar to the shared airport shuttles."
2132,4,265,['city'],An elevated train that ran throughout the city.
2133,4,265,['city'],"An elevated wagon wheel shaped, high speed rail system would be excellent. The outer ring would be bi-directional allowing quick transport around the city. The spokes would be bi-directional and allow quick transport from inner and outer within the quadrants."
2134,4,265,['city'],"An expansion of the skyrail or a similar system with connection to the skyrail could be added to the surrounding cities of Seattle. The addition of public transportation would cut pollution and reduce traffic congestion with the plus side of convenience. It would be a good idea to implement this idea while we still have space available, rather than wait until the problem is a burden."
2135,4,265,['city'],"An extensive network of electric vehicles that run off solar power. They sit out in the sun all day anyway, and can be shared and used as needed by the neighborhood. The neighborhood pays a monthly maintenance fee to use the vehicles. They may be used for shorter city trips."
2136,4,265,['city'],"An idea for getting around my city would be public Segways or other riding devices that you could take from station to station and plug back into a machine to charge up.  Obviously, anti-theft measures would have to be in place, but this could be really great in helping people get around."
2137,4,265,['city'],"An overhead puppy cart system, the same concept as in skii resorts. I live in NYC, and outside of traveling by train, there are no other practicals transportation which avoids traffic. Unlike the the train system, you would be able to make direct routes, with a bonus of great views around the city"
2138,4,265,['city'],"Another idea for a new transportation system would be a magnetic bullet train system, similar to the one they have in Japan. It would be a national rail system built over the old railroads we have now. It would go to every major city in America and would take half the time to do so."
2139,4,265,['city'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
2140,4,265,['city'],Automated Bicycle Rental Station. When i was visiting colorado i was so fascinated to see that they had Bicycle Rental Station nearly everywhere.  That be so cool to have in my city!
2141,4,265,['city'],"Automated taxi service. Would have several dispatch stations in key areas of city. Person could call for a ride from an app on their phone and it would send a car to them. The software could calculate rate for the trip and make you pay before as a confirmation before sending a car out. Car could then drive customer to said destination.  Self driveable cars that could provide a much better service than the often RUDE cab drivers could provide. Plus, I trust a robot way more than some of these morons driving!"
2142,4,265,['city'],Autonomous vehicles owned by the city.  Any individual (or at least city residents) can call or press a button for one at any time and the closest available vehicle will come pick you up and take you where you want to go.
2143,4,265,['city'],"AutoTram - The network of AutoTram tracks criss-cross major streets and also cut across the city in subterranean tunnels. Instead of larger vehicles that carry many people, but have rigid, pre-defined routes, the AutoTram is reserved through the internet, and will pick up and drop off several small groups of passengers who have stops along an arithmetically chosen route."
2144,4,265,['city'],Backpack rockets would be a great alternative to getting around this city. Since most places are within a 5 mile radius it would be a super convenient way to get around and would be totally affordable.
2145,4,265,['city'],Bike pathway bridges above the city. These pathways could connect schools and business and making them convenient would encourage more people to ride and less driving.
2146,4,265,['city'],bike sharing stands would be a welcome addition to my city.  Bikes you can rent at one place and drop off somewhere else.
2147,4,265,['city'],"Cars that can drive themselves, but people don't own them. They're a service provided by the city and you sign up for it and call when you need a car and the nearest one comes to you"
2148,4,265,['city'],"Chicago - Chicago has a great system and phenomenal public transport. As far as transportation though I wish the highways in the city acted like slotted cars, similar to trains in which in every highway entrance there would be a dedicated lane/railway for vehicles to travel at fast speeds like trains. This would reduce traffic and travel times."
2149,4,265,['city'],"City buses that actually go downtown and to the places that people need to go, instead of just around the edges of town. Also, have a fleet of bikes that people could rent for $1/hr to ride the distances downtown like some other cities."
2150,4,265,['city'],Create an underground rail system that allows people to travel to all major hubs of the city. This would save gas and ease pollution.
2151,4,265,['city'],"Currently, I live in a small town that has a public transportation system. However, you have to call and wait for the bus to pick you up, instead of waiting at a pre-determined stop, and it can take forever to get where you're going. I propose a busing system that's like the one in bigger cities for my neighborhood. People could still call and wait for a bus, but buses should also stop and pick people up at predetermined stops at regular intervals."
2152,4,265,['city'],"Currently, my city is very underserved by the public transportation system. I believe that the existing public transit should be expanded with a greater fleet of buses, so that all people in my community could be served. The buses currently in operation only reach about half (if that) of the city's occupants, leaving many without an opportunity to get where they need to go quickly and affordably."
2153,4,265,['city'],Developing a bike path throughout the neighborhood that goes directly to business locations would encourage more people to ride bikes and drive their cars less.  This bike path could snake all around the city with entries directly to all business locations making it an easy option for people.
2154,4,265,['city'],Electric buses would be an amazing addition to my city but we would have to integrate a system of cables that the city may or may not support. San Francisco has the ones I mean.
2155,4,265,['city'],Electric skate line that is powered throughout the whole city.
2156,4,265,['city'],"Elon Musk's Hyperloop, Hi speed trains traveling in tubes above the city."
2157,4,265,['city'],Firefighters are using jet-packs in Dubai to combat fires in skyscrapers. I propose we use jet-packs for personal transport. It's hard enough to travel in big cities like Miami with all the traffic. Having your own jet pack allows you to literally fly away from a stressful situation such as sitting in traffic or waiting for public transportation. It will save time and is fun. This futuristic technology is here and it works.
2158,4,265,['city'],Free bike exchange drop off type situation with buy in.  I'd like to pay a small fee to get a key to buy into a bike exchange that would be availible outside a number of locations spread thoughout the small city to use when i wish.
2159,4,265,['city'],"From small towns to big cities, public transportation is helping to generate new vitality like never

before. Beautiful, walkable town squares combine residential, retail, office, recreation and public

transportation features to make community living easy. New bus services and light rail extensions

improve mobility and ease congestion. Even the smallest adjustments, like widening sidewalks and

adding bikeways, can provide dramatic impact and value."
2160,4,265,['city'],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
2161,4,265,['city'],"Have a business where drivers rent cars, for hours and not days. The cars can be electric cars. Make them the cheapest cars possible. Make it for around the metro area only - and have the credit card swiper built into the car itself. In other words If you rent three hours with the car, it goes dead until you pay for more time. If someone takes it out of the pre-defined boundaries  of the city the car goes dead. You would have these little rental kiosks set up all over the city."
2162,4,265,['city'],Have a system of moving sidewalks that has chairs (with seatbelt for safety) mounted to it. People can just sit down and be transported quickly throughout the city.
2163,4,265,['city'],Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
2164,4,265,['city'],Have a system of skylift that can transport people within the city. This could really reduce traffic congestion. This network goes above the ground traffic and moves quickly.
2165,4,265,['city'],"Have a transportation system in the city where there is a tunneling system filled miniature train with small passenger capacity. These miniature trains can take people directly to their destination and the best part is that because they are small, there can be a large number of them running underneath the city."
2166,4,265,['city'],Have futuristic moving chairs that are installed onto side walks throughout the city. This will  enable people to just sit down and get to where they want to go!
2167,4,265,['city'],Have motorcycle drivers go around the city picking up passengers. It would be fun for the passengers and cause less pollution.
2168,4,265,['city'],"have soft landing missles ""shoot"" passengers from the suburbs to the city and back"
2169,4,265,['city'],"Have the streets be less wide, in order to have small row gardens on the sides on the sidewalks. This interactive, edible walkway would promote and provide sidewalk snacks and usability. Easy fresh pick veggetables and fruits, less flooding and more city beauty!"
2170,4,265,['city'],"Having charter buses pick you up from designated spots around the city and dropping you off in various locations around, such as the mall, groceries etc."
2171,4,265,['city'],"Having some sort of electric train that runs underground, just like the subway system in New York. The city that I currently live in doesn't have that option so having some sort of underground transportation system that runs all around the city constantly would make commuting much better for everyone."
2172,4,265,['city'],"High speed trains to commute into Chicago from various cities throughout northwest Indiana, with sleek train stations that include lots of amenities (coffee shops, dry cleaning, etc.)"
2173,4,265,['city'],Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.
2174,4,265,['city'],"How about a rent-a-Segway system?  Kind of like Zipcars or the bicycle rentals in big cities - you could pick up a Segway at a docking station in one part of town and then drop it off at one in another part of town.  You would probably need some sort of point of sale system for a deposit on the Segway, but otherwise the city could price it however they wanted."
2175,4,265,['city'],Human Tubes where people slide through interconnected tubes throughout the city in order to bypass traffic.
2176,4,265,['city'],Hyperloop install in the city with individual cars that will rapidly take to any point in the city within seconds.
2177,4,265,['city'],Hyperloop system that connects various California cities through ultra-fast tunnels
2178,4,265,['city'],I always thought they should incorporate moving sidewalks into the city. Just like the airport. This would allow people to scoot around faster without putting more people on the road.
2179,4,265,['city'],"I am from Cincinnati, and one new mode of transportation that would be great here is a subway system. Tunnels already exist from a failed project decades ago, but with the growth the city has seen, it could be a viable option."
2180,4,265,['city'],"I am thinking about a flying transport system. It should fly with balloon or air system. It should not need engine or fuel. So expence would be cheap. It should occupy 15-25 people at a time. It moves with air adjustment, drag, thrust, pressure etc. The flyer lands every important point in a city. So people can travel across the city with less time and money. No traffic block, signals, air pollution etc."
2181,4,265,['city'],I am thinking of something like a city bus system but for uber. Rather than having to go from stop to stop and hope people are there the bus system can be smarter and go to the most packed stops or to those who have been waiting the longest based upon when they clicked the app. It would be much more efficient.
2182,4,265,['city'],I believe a good future transportation system for my city would be a highspeed lightrail that can get people to their stop quickly and completely safely
2183,4,265,['city'],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
2184,4,265,['city'],"I don't anticipate the transportation system changing too much in my area no matter the time frame. I think the car will rule for the next several decades, but I would like the cars to change. They need not be so huge, and would be powered by plug-in type electrical engines. Each home would have a solar array and this would power your home, and your car. A back-up natural gas power plant would help out if it's cloudy for weeks. Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
2185,4,265,['city'],"I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
2186,4,265,['city'],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
2187,4,265,['city'],"I imagine a kind of moving walkway in the sky.  The moving walkway would be built on stilts above the ground. An individual can hop on the moving walkway and can walk to another part of the city, but at a faster rate than normal walking. This would encourage taking our own two feet as transportation."
2188,4,265,['city'],"I imagine a loop in my city where anyone would be able to have a short walk to the 'main artery' and be able to get anywhere at a major point within minutes; perhaps this would be a rail suspended above the city, or otherwise away from other major traffic; it would really help in efficiency of moving people around."
2189,4,265,['city'],"I imagine a series of widening arches or loops of roadway and of several different sizes to accompany different types of pubic transport. Cars wouldn't be allowed in the city but stored at various exit point garages which would be provided by the city. Small roads would have small shuttles, large roads would have large fast moving shuttles that span the city. Independently, smaller walkways would be used for pedestrians and cyclists (and other man powered or tiny engine machines.) Larger walkways could become festival street fair type roads that are common in places like Greece."
2190,4,265,['city'],"I imagine a train line that rings the entire city, with interstitial lines to service the downtown areas."
2191,4,265,['city'],I imagine a transportation system in which we all use underground super chutes. They move us from place to place within our town super fast. It would have to be set up so everything is safe of course. I imagine a network of these chutes spreading throughout the city and they pop you up wherever you want to go. Wouldn't that be amazing?
2192,4,265,['city'],"I live in a fairly small town that has a decent amount of people but isn't very large in area. Solar powered railcars could be a viable option for this area. They would only have to travel short distances at once, and it could easily be utilized by everybody in town by having just a few stops. Think about the railcars in San Francisco and other major cities being completely solar powered. The electricity saving would be huge."
2193,4,265,['city'],I live in a rural community about 1 hour from a city. I would like to see this area build a light rail commuter line that could link these isolated communities and boost the economy. Many people out here do not even have cars.
2194,4,265,['city'],"I live in a small desert city with a major traffic congestion issue. However, despite the grid layout of the town, there is a diagonal irrigation canal running from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. Currently it has some poorly maintained walking paths, but that's about the extent of its development. Now, in the desert, loss of irrigation water to evaporation under the glaring sun is an issue. I'd propose creating a covered walkway/bike path where solar panels provide protection to the water, as well as pedestrians and cyclists. We could even use that solar energy to create small electric scooter rental/charging booths. It would provide a shortcut - a green highway from one end of town to the other."
2195,4,265,['city'],"I live in an area where there are a lot of senior citizens so driving can sometimes be scary, and I think this city would greatly benefit from public transportation. However, I think something that would benefit the environment would be the most helpful, so I think pushcarts would be a lot of fun, or even horse drawn carriages. Not only would these be better for the environment, but I think the older people would appreciate the old-fashioned nature of such public transport systems."
2196,4,265,['city'],I live in the suburbs so all the rail lines converge on the central city. It would be nice if there was a light rail system that linked the different major suburbs together. You could connect it to the lines going to the city and across the country.
2197,4,265,['city'],"I lived in Japan and really enjoyed their system of underground rail. I think most cities in the United States could benefit from such a system, which has the added benefit of cutting down on DUIs. There is no rail system in my town."
2198,4,265,['city'],"I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city. Would take ten minutes max to board and 10-15 minutes to go downtown."
2199,4,265,['city'],I picture a streamlined 'box' like a cable car that is hanging from a line or track throughout the city. It would be shaped like a rectangle with smooth edges and very compact and sleak. It glides up to the booth where people may get on and each cable car 'box' can hold 6 people in 3 rows of 2 with a small walking aisle to the side.
2200,4,265,['city'],I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
2201,4,265,['city'],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
2202,4,265,['city'],I think a spiral starting from the center of the city going out to the edges of the city.  The spiral should be able to get all the areas if it's only 2-3 blocks wide.  It would have a dedicated lane so traffic wouldn't affect the bus and vice versa.  There would be a way to quickly have people enter and exit the bus and this would keep it on time.  Of course the bus is electric powered.
2203,4,265,['city'],I think a trolley system would work really well here. I live in Fort Collins and the city is very centralized but the traffic is terrible - perfect for a trolley!
2204,4,265,['city'],I think adding a rail system in my city would be a great idea. The only public transportation we have is buses and there are a lot of areas they don't even run to. So I think a rail system would do wonders in getting a lot of other people where they were going.
2205,4,265,['city'],I think because my city isn't THAT big a place that takes us to all the the important parts is vital. You would think a bus would do that but not the ones in my city. It's just small stops.
2206,4,265,['city'],"I think high-speed tube travel would be great in my city. The tubes could be a system of plastic or rubber tubes that were buried underground. There would be a lot of tube stations downtown, but they would branch off to the outer city and suburbs. These tubes would have pods in them that were propelled by high-pressured air. The pods could be designed to carry one or two people each, and would be shot through the tubes for quick travel to your destination."
2207,4,265,['city'],I think my neighborhood and the surrounding city could use some sort of collection of energy efficient trams that can network passengers along the old railways that are no longer in use.
2208,4,265,['city'],I think my neighborhood could benefit from ride-sharing bikes. We live in a suburb of Boston but technically a City. Not the easiest to get around and a lot to do.
2209,4,265,['city'],I think that we need a rail system for our city. Its a growing city with lost of bigger cities around it. A main rail system like a subway would make things much easier to get from place to place.
2210,4,265,['city'],"I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
2211,4,265,['city'],"I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
2212,4,265,['city'],"I think we could have carpool vans that schedule drop offs for us in the city which could save gas and promote a green clean transportation system. Also, we could take turns as drivers, with GPS equipped and a convertible top for sunny days."
2213,4,265,['city'],"I want a large, underground series of tunnels that offer a combination of walking paths, bike paths, and people movers so that people can easily move around the city during winter. As this would have a large number of entrances and exists, it would be more flexible (and cheaper) than the subway."
2214,4,265,['city'],"I want a monorail system to run above street level (may be 20 feet up or so).  I want it to connect the suburbs to downtown, and circle the city.  It would run on magnets so that it would be extremely quiet.  It would be extremely fast.  I want it to provide a bird's eye view for commuters.  It would be a very safe way to travel, crime and personal safety would not be an issue."
2215,4,265,['city'],"I want an elevated railway that preserves nature, resists going down during snow and bad weather, and reaches all areas of my city. It would be public transportation and have low-cost monthly passes. It would also run on renewable, clean energy."
2216,4,265,['city'],"I was thinking that since the city I live in has a decently sized river, to save money, be cost effective, and lower power/energy usage, we can ferry people and personnel to central districts of the city and my neighborhood. Maybe the ferries/boat could be turbine powered to be more energy efficient."
2217,4,265,['city'],"I wish we could get treadmill bikes. I saw a quick video of one invented in the U.K. I think. You walk on it and that powers a motor so you can move quickly even if you are just walking. We have many runners and walkers in our city, but only on trails or parks. If you could use them on the streets to actually get places it would be wonderful. You would also have to add some sort of safe parking places so they don't get stolen as I'm not sure you can lock them up."
2218,4,265,['city'],"I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
2219,4,265,['city'],"I would like a city trolley. The trolley would travel around the city several times a day, taking and picking up residents from the major shopping areas. The trolley stops should be no more than two blocks from any neighborhood."
2220,4,265,['city'],"I would like a free car sharing service.  So the city provides cars, but that can only be used if they are full, so that you have an incentive to carpool, and as long as you do, you get a free ride."
2221,4,265,['city'],I would like it if the area I lived in used a bike sharing system like I have seen in some other major cities like Portland and Minneapolis.
2222,4,265,['city'],I would like our city to have a railway system like downtown Miami. Its computer operated and is over ground. This means it wont impact traffic at all. Its a fast and easy service and its going to make things easier for all.
2223,4,265,['city'],"I would like some sort of conveyor belt system or moving walkway (possibly with seats) in my city. It seems like it would be really nice for people, since people walk a lot here. Also, if there was a way to sit while moving, people could get work done and other things, while taking a 'slow ride' down the street (slower than a train, etc, so people can get on/ off while it's moving)."
2224,4,265,['city'],"I would like to have a subterranean network of moving roller coaster type tracks that move people to any location in the city easily, and deliver them right to the door step of where they need to go. This could be done by having exit points from the underground network of tracks that bring you to specific address clusters."
2225,4,265,['city'],"I would like to have small trams throughout the county, making it more convenient for people to travel from city to city without stopping"
2226,4,265,['city'],I would like to imagine being able to create a app and that uses credit cards. and invent a motorcycle scooter that has a huge row of seats in the back and runs like a mini van and use it as a taxi service. for only the city that I live in and name it Go Scooter transportation.
2227,4,265,['city'],I would like to see a cable car that runs across the city.  It would take people across the busy streets.  It would be convenient for office workers. It would cut down on traffic in the downtown area.
2228,4,265,['city'],I would like to see a high speed train connect all the major cities in my state as well as the major cities bordering our state.  I envision this high speed train to have minimal stations.  This would eliminate the need for air travel and long road trips.
2229,4,265,['city'],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
2230,4,265,['city'],"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
2231,4,265,['city'],I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
2232,4,265,['city'],I would love a rail system to be installed in our city going north/south along the coast.
2233,4,265,['city'],"I would love for there to a more intergrated train system in my city (specifically my neighborhood.) I'd love to be able to hop on a train (or streetcar) and be able to transfer to a larger rail system that would take me to other cities, etc. Something like what european cities have."
2234,4,265,['city'],"I would love individual Segway transporters that would go from the house to the transit station.  They would just fit one person and keep them dry.  Only about 1 mile but just far enough in the rain not to walk.  Once at the transit station, the train takes you directly every 5 minutes into the city."
2235,4,265,['city'],"I would love it if the city made walking and riding a bike more user friendly. There are no areas that are safe for pedestrians or bikers. If there were a bike lane, more people could move independently and get to where they are going. Commuters using more than one mode of transportation would be able to get to their destinations more quickly and with greater safety."
2236,4,265,['city'],"I would love to see an Uber type of program but for doctor appointments. Where the doctor's office has drivers who are willing to pick up patients and drop them back off at home. Maybe like 1 person driving in a city and just bringing the patients to the doctor so that people won't have to drive to the doctor, especially older people."
2237,4,265,['city'],"I would love to see some kind of computer-operated taxi service in my city. The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
2238,4,265,['city'],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
2239,4,265,['city'],"I'd like to see underground travel possible through out the city.   Some massive tunnels, where you would have to take side tunnels to exits, but there would be major arteries.  It would replace a lot of above ground roads."
2240,4,265,['city'],"I'd love to see a crowdsourced method of alternate transportation in my city, where people could request rides from others who happen to be in the area and going the direction you need to with a minimal cost. There are so many people who have cars and it would be a great option for people who don't have reliable access to one. It could use cell phone apps and perhaps even have a traditional component using telephone for people who are less technologically inclined. The biggest challenge would be safety/security, and I'm honestly not sure how to overcome that aspect. There could be specific stops, almost like bus stops, where people could gather and wait for rides, or schedule rides to pick them up at certain times."
2241,4,265,['city'],"I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
2242,4,265,['city'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
2243,4,265,['city'],Im from Seattle and it is mostly built over the top of the old city that burned down. I would think that they'd be able to build subways here at least through the downtown area where they have underground tours of the city.
2244,4,265,['city'],"In my city, it is almost impossible to not having a car since the public transportation is not that good. However, car ownership can be quite expensive. Car sharing could reduce the cost of having a car, we can build a system that anyone can use a ""public"" car that can be shared after paying a certain fixed cost up-front and hourly/daily rate afterward."
2245,4,265,['city'],In my neighborhood I think the best type of transportation system would be an elevated railway like a tram at disney world it would make commuting between neighboring cities far easier and the technology would make commutes more timely.
2246,4,265,['city'],"In my neighborhood, any kind of public transportation would be innovative. Due to the apparent stigma of such, I would propose a lovely electric-run ""uber coach"" instead of the big ugly city bus. This could be as simple as a mini-van and could deliver us suffering commuters of Southern California from a few select and regular pick-up spots to bigger, car-pool mega spots at various freeway points."
2247,4,265,['city'],In the city i live in there is no public transportation. If some rails or buses could be brought in it could help a lot of people here.
2248,4,265,['city'],Instead of buses or trains that come at specific times there would be a looped track with chairs that circles the city constantly there would never be a wait as it would be running constantly.
2249,4,265,['city'],Instead of traveling people can log on to fully functional robots around the city. When they are done they log off so someone else can use them. They would be able to function just like a human body.
2250,4,265,['city'],"Interactive bus schedule app. You pick the starting destination and ending point, plus leave time and it will tell you what time the bus comes to that point, what the ETA and travel schedule is. Also would give a total cost for the trip. I live in a neighboring county and the small bus hooks up with the city bus, but I have no idea what time the bus comes to the bus stop by my house, nor how I would transfer to the bus that takes me to work."
2251,4,265,['city'],It would be a new school bus system that runs on renewable energy. No more gas would be needed to get the kids to school and back home. Making our city one more step greener and setting the bar high!
2252,4,265,['city'],It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
2253,4,265,['city'],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
2254,4,265,['city'],"It would be great for our city to offer more access to the rails.  We could use an updated rail system that would make traveling to our larger cities in the state faster, more available, and yet still affordable.  It could bring more people to live in our city if they could travel fast to the big city and help grow our town here.  Our town is terribly depressed and I think that having a high-speed train or just general more options to travel through it would bring a massive amount of revenue into the city."
2255,4,265,['city'],"It would be great to have a bike share program in my neighborhood. Just have a couple bike lock stations and have the city get us a bunch of bikes, and just use the bikes as we need them and park then when we're done."
2256,4,265,['city'],"it'd be cool to have a rent a shop throughout the city for people who aren't able to afford bicycles or scooters, or any other sort of transportations. the can rent an item, and return it at the other part of town."
2257,4,265,['city'],Light rail around the city.
2258,4,265,['city'],Light rail connecting outer neighborhoods to the city would be good for everyone for jobs and business.
2259,4,265,['city'],"Monorail through the city! Just like Disneyland, this city-wide system allows you to see the city from a bird's eye! Simply get on at one of the many stations around town and enjoy your ride without stops, traffic or bad weather. The rails above the city means growth can continue without getting in the way of transport, and means you can watch the world below!"
2260,4,265,['city'],More bike routes around the city for better and eco-friendly travel.
2261,4,265,['city'],Motorcycle/ Scooter IS VERY USEING IN THE CITY
2262,4,265,['city'],"Moving platforms that function like traincars and moving sidewalks put together. They would go above roads, have railings on each side and be like busses with bus stops. You could buy a thing like a bus pass that allows you x number of rides, so that you don't have to have cash on your person to be able to get on it. It would run from neighborhoods to main city areas and only be running when people call for it/use it to save money on electricity/gas/whatever"
2263,4,265,['city'],"Moving sidewalks all over the city would be amazing. People could hop on and even sit and get to their destination.  They'd be like the ones in airports, but they would go faster.  Some could even run into and through tubes so people would be protected in bad weather.  Something like a gerbil habitat would be amazing.  I think it would promote people walking instead of driving.  Or, just standing on the moving sidewalks.  It would reduce pollution if people took things like this around the city."
2264,4,265,['city'],"My city is a little small and close together. Most people use a car or the bus. I think it would be a great idea if more people rode bicycles, and I don't think it would take much longer to get where they need to go."
2265,4,265,['city'],My city is currently looking at High Occupancy Travel toll lanes.  I've thought that a dedicated lane for buses or van pools would be an alternative that could let the car commuters see the speed at which these other options can get to work.  This would encourage the use of the bus / van pool options.
2266,4,265,['city'],"My city is right on the ocean and there are many canals within the city as well, so I think a kind of transportation system with water taxis or some kind of water buses would be really useful. In a lot of cases I think this kind of transportation would be faster and more accessible to people, especially if it was willing to pick people up at designated locations or even right off their own docks for those who have them."
2267,4,265,['city'],My city needs a monorail that transports people from the suburbs to downtown and vice versa. the highways are not very good at providing an efficient way. A monorail would be fast and perfect
2268,4,265,['city'],my city needs a subway system badly. A subway system would run in a star shaped pattern through the city and eliminate the terrible traffic in my city
2269,4,265,['city'],"My city would benefit from an elevated and enclosed train line. Regional rail is the preferred choice for many commuters but is unreliable and frustrating due to weather and traffic related delays. Though the infrastructure investment would be great, we are in need of an overhaul anyway and should improve the current system."
2270,4,265,['city'],My idea is to use special parking lots for energy efficient vehicles in order to give incentive to the use of cleaner energy. These parking lots could be in the more crowded city areas and you'd need a special pass or something after having your vehicle cleared.
2271,4,265,['city'],My Idea would be to make the alleyways in my city a lot more bike friendly.  Honestly they are very rarely ever used by the city or homeowners so to make them this way would be beneficial for so many others. This would I believe encourage more people to use bicycles since I know I am terrified when riding my bicycle next to extremely lage and fast moving automobile traffic on my cities roads and highways.
2272,4,265,['city'],"My neighborhood filled with uber drives. However, there is no cost assoicated with the transit it is all provided by the town. It would be like new york city (think of cabs), however nice black cars everywhere and someone can hop in to any one they want free of charge. Baisically be like public transit with uber and they will take you wherever you want."
2273,4,265,['city'],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
2274,4,265,['city'],"My neighborhood/city/state is ultra conservative- so having bike lanes would be an improvement. Even though this city I live in (Huntsville, AL) has more Ph.D's per capita we are still woefully behind. Since it's such a tech town with so many engineers though...it would have to be something very advanced to get these engineers on board. Like some sort of train driven by magnetic rails."
2275,4,265,['city'],My new transportation system would be a golf cart system. We have many elderly people who would enjoy being able to get around using golf carts. It would be a wa around the city without having to use the highway.
2276,4,265,['city'],"Not just in my neighborhood but metro-wide, my city recently established time share bicycles people can rent and ride when they have a short distance to travel. The bikes are all of the same design, having a large sturdy frame painted light blue, three gears (the gear box is inside the rear wheel axle, and LED blinker lights for safety. Necessarily, it's a one-size-fits-all arrangement; there's no way to raise or lower the seat unless you carry your own tools around with you, so if you're a tall person and use one of these bikes you'll be knocking yourself in the chin with your knees."
2277,4,265,['city'],Now Houston already have public bike stations. These stations allow someone to check out a bike for the day for a small fee. In some other cities someone has the choice to rent a car for the day using a credit card . The cars are eco friendly and cost very little to rent. I'm not talking about CarMax. This service is similar to the same service that is offered to rent bikes here in Houston. I think Houston should think about bringing the idea to the city .
2278,4,265,['city'],"Our City has no nearby neighbors. Any future ideas are going to require a rail system, preferably something fast like japanese trains. Maglev technology which will allow faster travel from coastal towns and cities to the capital."
2279,4,265,['city'],our city is metro .population is a big problem there and traffic too .large no of people use public transport like trains and buses but also use scooter in large nos as its easy to go to places when there is lot of traffic on rads to avoid jams.
2280,4,265,['city'],"Our small city is fairly bike/walker friendly, but I think a bike rental kiosk or a bike trading program would be so helpful. I don't own a bike, but I'd like for it to be easier and quicker to get around without driving."
2281,4,265,['city'],"People should ride horses around the city.  They can either ride the horse itself or go in a carriage ride attached to it.  I think there is a certain charm in riding a horse or travelling by carriage.  It would be a throwback to vintage type days when people rode in stagecoaches. I think it could revitalize a city and make old-fashioned things trendy again.  Horses/carriages could move people around from popular destinations in the city to other popular destinations.  Kids would love it!  ""Mom, let's take the horse today!"""
2282,4,265,['city'],"People with money will have personal drones that are an encapsulated metal tube with glass doors and windows. The user simply programs their destination into the computer and the drone will deliver them there with non-collision software. There will be various ""drone zones"" throughout the city where people can take off and land."
2283,4,265,['city'],Perhaps a system where you can rent out bicycles or motorbikes to get to where you need to go. You could hold a lot of them in one area and make it easy to check out the bike and then return it later. It would help getting around for people who can't afford a car service to take them around the city but also for people who prefer to be health conscious and also want to save money by biking around the city.
2284,4,265,['city'],Personal drone helicopters that people can fly around in. This would be useful in places such as cities.
2285,4,265,['city'],pod like stock cars for city that run on electric. They can be in routes and be like taxis but driverless.
2286,4,265,['city'],Public Busses is best the mode of transport most frequently used in my city
2287,4,265,['city'],"Public transportation should be free a few times per month -- maybe one weekend day or holiday, and one working day.  This will cause less people to drive and improve the environment, and bring in more transportation money to the city.  Also, it would urge people to tell their elected officials to improve public transportation so that they can take advantage of it more."
2288,4,265,['city'],"Public transportation that may have a few bikes on the front that you can borrow/rent. Having the bikes attached to public transportation could help you to go further and maybe get around another city that has other things to offer, other than your own, where you may use the bikes at hand."
2289,4,265,['city'],"Public, foot-based transportation. Something like the automatic walkways in airports, but for long stretches of large cities, particularly between common high-traffic areas. It would probably be best if the walkways were raised, to avoid conflict with other ground traffic. It must also include access for the disabled, be easy enough for even tech-fearful users, and extremely safe (with monitored auto-shutoff where applicable)."
2290,4,265,['city'],"Railway tunnels off of the highways (outdoor subways) to provide a fast paced mode of transportation on busy streets that work with a system like uber that will have drivers readily available at each location. More for suburban areas, not large city areas that have subway/rail systems."
2291,4,265,['city'],"Rent a scooter in the summer. These would be like the automatic bike rental stations in many cities, only you'd rent rechargable electric scooters. Station would charge them"
2292,4,265,['city'],Rent cars for a day. Each city has a system where you can rent cars for a certain amount of time for a fee.
2293,4,265,['city'],"Ride scooters to a local bus stop that. Houses scooters on the bus, up to 10 miles from house, to work in the inner city, (25 miles from bus stop) it would save gas and pollution, instead of 25 people driving take a bus. Scooters get better Mpg and it's safer to stay on a bus on a highway than a scooter."
2294,4,265,['city'],Scooter would be great transportation for college kids and busy cities.
2295,4,265,['city'],Segway automated rentals. Like the bike racks in large public cities. You put down a deposit with a credit card and when you return it you get most of the deposit back.
2296,4,265,['city'],Segways!  Segway sidewalks that go over streets and above the normal sidewalks people walk on so you can ride your segway without stopping for traffic or having to worry about a pedestrian taking up space to get by. Segway sidewalks can even run on the edge of a major highway in bigger cities like mine to keep routes short and simple. We can even make the segways charge on solar power so they will never go dead while you're out running about.
2297,4,265,['city'],"Shared bike system - everyone has access to a system of bicycles that are evenly distributed throughout the city via ""bike parking lots."" Punch in a code, get a bike for the day, return it to another station later."
2298,4,265,['city'],Skyline car- Have pods that move above the buildings and are connected to main areas of interest. People can pay a toll to use them and be transported around the city
2299,4,265,['city'],Small drones of the size of birds should be invented so that they can monitor the cities properly
2300,4,265,['city'],Some kind of public transportation like light rail that goes nearby would be ideal. If we could have a light rail or subway system that connects the city to the suburbs that would greatly improve the traffic situation.
2301,4,265,['city'],"Some sort of free bicycle rides.  It would work by having you use a credit card (so people cannot steal bicycles) as a deposit.   Here's how it would work.  You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.    If you don't return the bike, it would charge your card aka ask for a retransmission of said packet.  That's all I have for now."
2302,4,265,['city'],Something akin to a streetcar or trolley bus system could be very useful in my city.  It would have its own designated lane and be a useful public transportation alternative.
2303,4,265,['city'],"Something like a chair lift system except that it is very fast and reliable. It would be located in the most frequented hubs in the city and each chair would be a single seat so there is no worry about people being isolated in ""pods"" with strangers which could be dangerous."
2304,4,265,['city'],Stalls that allow people to rent and drop off bicycles so they can get around the city without wasting gas and causing pollution. Implant GPS devices inside the bikes so they can't be stolen.
2305,4,265,['city'],teleportation. all you have to do is build a teleporter at each major hub in your city and you're golden
2306,4,265,['city'],Teleporters should be located a certain points in the city.  A person can simply teleport to their desired location.
2307,4,265,['city'],the best transportation where i live is a personal car. it is the fastest and most convenient for the type of city i live in.
2308,4,265,['city'],The Car is a tech-related industry. Personal transport in the best transport most frequently used in my city.
2309,4,265,['city'],"The city could do a partial co pay or cheap taxi or destination bus service. as in you meet the bus at a specific pick up place but then you tell the address you want, no designated stop."
2310,4,265,['city'],"The city has recently built a set of rollerblade kiosks that allow people to rent skates in their size.  By putting in their cash or credit card, they can rent them to go visit other locations and get a small refund when they return them to another kiosk."
2311,4,265,['city'],"The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
2312,4,265,['city'],The future of transportation in my city is by having self-automated driverless cars. They would reduce the amount of traffic congestion and reduce the number of car accidents.
2313,4,265,['city'],"The future transportation system in me neighborhood is going to consist of driverless vehicles that hover and travel with the help of magnetism. The vehicles have built in solar panels that operate throughout the city 24/7. These vehicles all have routines they follow everyday so people just have to transfer according to where they want to go. On the other hand, if people want to own their own vehicle then it is possible. They can travel where ever they want to and all they have to do is to recharge their solar battery in the sunlight."
2314,4,265,['city'],The idea is that free long term parking is offered at multiple nodes throughout the outskirts of the city. Within the city there are three primary modes of transport: public bicycles (if needed) for short distances between bus stops for medium distances and at key points throughout the city train stations for the longest stretches for cross city travel.
2315,4,265,['city'],"The mode of transportation that I would imagine would be no different than an average city street. However, with the right conductors placed under the street the friction created by people's feet as they walked would supply supplemental power to the city. As such a person could get a ""walker"" designation that they could either receive some incentive for (pay or reduced taxes). This would get people more active and save the governemtn money and reduce environmental damage (through the waste of resources and nuclear power)."
2316,4,265,['city'],The neighborhood needs a rail system that runs adjacent to the highway. This would go from major city to major city with the same stops as for those that drive.
2317,4,265,['city'],"The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
2318,4,265,['city'],"The suburbs are not currently served by the bus system. I believe that each suburb should get its own bus, which will take riders to a bus stop in the city. There, they may catch another bus or walk to their destination."
2319,4,265,['city'],"The transportation system is much into the future where you get into a cylinder and press your destination on the buttons, somewhat like an elevator. The tube launches and within minutes, you arrive at your destination within the city limits. The cylinder, if you can imagine, is one like what you put your deposits in at a bank window."
2320,4,265,['city'],There are a series of tubes that go over the city. The people get in and it acts like a pneumatic tube that sucks them to the next destination. It would be best for personal transport and no luggage would be allowed.
2321,4,265,['city'],there are no trains in my city
2322,4,265,['city'],There are two different modes of transportation within my city. The first one is a car. They usually have four doors on the left and right sides of them that open outwardly. There are four wheels and windows towards the top of the vehicle for viewing. The steering gear is located in the front seat on the left hand side and is controlled by the driver.
2323,4,265,['city'],"There is no public transportation in my neighborhood. We do not even have sidewalks for pedestrians. It is a major problem that I wish could be fixed, but no one cares about rural cities."
2324,4,265,['city'],"There should be a completely separate bike lane that runs throughout the city, and is plowed even during the winter.  Currently the biking situation isn't too bad, but there are areas where it is hard to feel safe with cars passing by too closely.  During the winter, it is impossible to bike due to snow in the bike lanes"
2325,4,265,['city'],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
2326,4,265,['city'],"There should be large carousel in the city that circles the block, so people just get on a horse and go where they can."
2327,4,265,['city'],"There should be paid service for a bus route to pick up people who live right outside a city. I will use my self as an example for my idea. I live about 20 miles for a major city . If I didn't have a automobile I would not be able to get anywhere important. Now the nearest cilty has a bus route only for those in the city. But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area. The school bus service already does this , I don't know why the city could come up with a plan to offer public transportation for adults living in rural areas. It's just very stupid that this is not a thing in Houston ."
2328,4,265,['city'],There would be a pay-to-use bicycle system similar to the Citi bicycles in New York City. It would allow people to exercise while getting to their location quickly. It would also relieve traffic congestion.
2329,4,265,['city'],"There would be a street train that would take people from downtown down the main road to the city limits. It would also connect to service to the next big city over. Bus service would be more frequent, and Uber would be allowed to begin service."
2330,4,265,['city'],There would be skateboard like devices that run on tracks that are embedded into the roads of the city. People could use a phone app to schedule for one of the boards to pick them up. The device would show up int he street outside of your house or wherever you currently are. You would hop on and you would put the address into the app of where you wanted to go.
2331,4,265,['city'],This idea is about cable bus. Bus moving through cable in air. The cables are places all across the city in air. The bus moves across the cable without any traffic block. There will be stops.
2332,4,265,['city'],"This idea is called 'Rolling taxi'. The system is a large ball. single large ball. Inside the ball, people can sit . People sit or stand at the centre of the ball. As ball rolls on specially made road the centre region doesn't move. The centre region where people sit is attached to the  inner surface of the ball in a special manner so that people do not move. The speed and direction of the ball can control using technology. The ball roll all across the city with people inside on a special track. Speed is high and expense is less. Also it is fun."
2333,4,265,['city'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
2334,4,265,['city'],This is a hybrid airship. Technology has developed that allows these vehicles to be more compact and use hydrogen lift cells safely. There are dozens of air ferries lifting people quietly into the air and to major cities all across America. The carbon footprint of the consumer aviation industry is drastically reduced. The noise pollution of traditional airports is all but gone. The hybrid airship is the vehicle of choice in terms of transportation.
2335,4,265,['city'],"This is a transportation system that delivers food directly to people's houses. It exists in a large city and people will use an App on their phones to get food delivered to their house. They can enter the restaurant, find out what they want, and someone will deliver the food item by any mean they choose whether it be car or bicycle or walking. The app will also store people's favorite orders at their restaurants so they don't have to think about what to order."
2336,4,265,['city'],"This is about a single user system. It is similar to a bicycle. But it's does not run on road. It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable. We take it from home or rent from government."
2337,4,265,['city'],"This might be only useful for some places, but it's better than none.  I think there should be a moving walkway for the most common areas of a town or city.  This way foot traffic can be consistent and the flow high.  Since it's fairly low speed there shouldn't be any injury issues and transferring is as easy as getting off the one walkway and on to another."
2338,4,265,['city'],"Ticket sharing system for people who make infrequent trips into the city, or suddenly need to do several trips in a row. A group of people could collectively share a commuter pass for the train or bus system. It would be like a Netflix of commuter passes. The ticket could be held in an existing business or maybe a library, and the ticket would be checked out like a book. People would pay each day they hold the ticket."
2339,4,265,['city'],"To help cover a lot of area of a city, the could be a central hub where all the trains, busses, etc start.  Then from that one spot, all the route lines shoot out, like a star.  That way all the people can be at one spot and make it to where they want to go easily since there are no transfers or any other confusing things."
2340,4,265,['city'],Tubes that are linked together and are wide enough to fit a person laying down. People get in a capsule and are delivered in great speeds to their destination by using compressed air or other methods. You can have tube terminals all over the city.
2341,4,265,['city'],use self-driving cars to get to different parts of the city
2342,4,265,['city'],Vacuum tube travel with a central hub in various outlying cities
2343,4,265,['city'],We could have helicopters that move from certain places in the city to farther ones.  Somewhat like a light rail system but from different ends of the city.  It could make jumps to each different port that would be faster than any other travel.
2344,4,265,['city'],We could have tubes going from the center of the city and increasingly farther out in each direction.  A person could fit in the tube and it would suck them to the other end quickly.  It would then have  a pad to stop them at the end.
2345,4,265,['city'],"we need dedicated motorcycle streets, preferably underground, i live in a very populated city (not LA status but still very urban) and ive often thought that a small underground road system built primarily for two wheeled street vehicles would not only cut down on traffic but the pollotuion created could them be trapped and prevented from being released into the atmosphere... it would cause motorcycle sales to skyrocket and there by provide another added economic benefit."
2346,4,265,['city'],"we need individual stand up scooters for citys almost like the 2 wheeled ones we have now but run on electric under the road, or even like personal unicycles that take people around. totally different topic how about Walmart allows you to make your shopping list online and they drop it off at your house on routes city distribution"
2347,4,265,['city'],We ought to revisit the trolley system because the buses in New York City are plagued by heavy traffic. We should have electric trolleys on main thoroughfares. It worked in the old days. Sometimes old ideas mixed with new technology is GENIUS!
2348,4,265,['city'],We should be giving people a tax deduction for doing more walking and/or bike riding to reduce transportation in vehicles.  This applies to my city because everything is so close!
2349,4,265,['city'],We should have an underground subway system. For a city as large as the one I live in it would make sense. It would be faster for everyone and clear the roads of buses that clog up traffic during rush hour.
2350,4,265,['city'],"We will have cars that can lift off the ground and ""fly"" with a air propel system. This would be fast enough for them to travel in that city area without hitting any others."
2351,4,265,['city'],"What we need is a better public transportation system that services the East end of the city.  Perhaps a bullet shuttle that will pick up in certain areas of the East End, and shuttle t predetermined locations within the city such as the downtown area, in addition to other areas."
2352,4,265,['city'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
2353,4,265,['city'],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
2354,5,241,['transportation'],"A form of alternative transportation would be in the form of an SUV crossed with a 4wheeler. However, it would need to be affordable and able to be driven on main roads."
2355,5,241,['transportation'],"A form of transportation similar to an airlift, only the seats are at terminals on the ground. You board and they take you to predesignated stops in a direct line, free of traffic. Like a shuttle or train, only on a smaller scale, and ideally seats come in much more frequently, every 30 seconds or so."
2356,5,241,['transportation'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
2357,5,241,['transportation'],"A human tube system, similar to televison shows like Futurama, and already in use by banks, albeit for parcels and not people. If we installed vacuum tubes that led to a multitude of central destinations, we could develop a toll system alongside it. Using air pressure would cut out emissions immensely, and would be relatively fast, allowing for faster travel times than traditional modes of transportation. However, the difficulty would come from utilizing the system in such a way that remained safe for all those involved, perhaps through making use of a stop and go turbine system, that worked similarly to a stop light. A smart air restriction system would allow for one way travel, and then a short delay, followed by travel in the other direction."
2358,5,241,['transportation'],"A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.  They would park their cars before entering the city, and use this quick system for getting around.  No more crowded, expensive parking in the city."
2359,5,241,['transportation'],A monorail type transportation system.
2360,5,241,['transportation'],"A network of green transportation for rent. You insert coins and it releases a bike, a skateboard, a scooter or some other form of efficient transportation. You drive it to your destination and once you deliver it to the hotpspot you can get your money back, if it is in good condition."
2361,5,241,['transportation'],A new form of transportation that could be well used in my community would be a large seating vehicle that took people on and off the local military bases. There are 5 bases here and in the morning and evening commute there are traffic issues around those bases. A way to remove at least half the vehicles could cut down on pollution and traffic around the base for people off the base as well as on. This would be a military carpool of sorts to also eliminate parking issues.
2362,5,241,['transportation'],A new innovative transportation system would be automated cars. They can pick you up and drop you off wherever you need to be.
2363,5,241,['transportation'],A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
2364,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation idea would be to have bikes that can be rented.  I have seen this in some towns such as Austin, Texas.  Where you can find a bank of rental bikes every couple of blocks.  How awesome would it be if this was more normal and people could choose to ride a bike to the store to grab a loaf of bread or something, rather than getting in the car and wasting gas and adding to pollution."
2365,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation method could be using self driving vehicles. During times when you are needing to pre drink before going to a bar to save money, you find yourself unable to drive to the said bar. With self driving vehicles, you can let the robot do the critical thinking for you to ensure your safe arrival to your friendly neighborhood bar. This would be fun and convenient. This would also reduce the amount of wrecks on a friday and saturday night."
2366,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation system  can be something somewhat like a train, but a small train like shuttle, which can take others around the neighborhood, easy, fast and no traffic."
2367,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
2368,5,241,['transportation'],A new transportation system for our neighborhood could be shared scooters.  The scooters would be open for all to use and stocked at locations around the neighborhood.  You could check them out and return them for less money than the cost of a scooter.
2369,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood could be the use of drones to fly individuals in and around town, or to far off destinations. The drones would fly like helicopters, but can  can also be controlled using a remote control. Unlike a car which can transport several passengers, the drone would be only be able to transport one person."
2370,5,241,['transportation'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
2371,5,241,['transportation'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
2372,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be similar to a train line, just on a smaller scale. It would pick people up in a series of pods and deposit them at their place of work for a small fee. This new train type line could also be used in the same way that a bus is, to run errands. The new system would have comfortable couch like chairs and be far more acceptable than the current forms of trnasportation availabe."
2373,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation system uses solar panel on the roads to empower vehicles to travel around the city. As vehicles get on the road, it automatically connects on the server of the roads and energies stored on boxes on street corners come one. These vehicles do not use gasoline, ethanol or diesel. It is greenhouse and uses electricity collected from the sun. Renewable energy that saves money and free to the entire residents meaning as long as the sun still shines, vehicles will work."
2374,5,241,['transportation'],"A new transportation system would be a large electric powered bus. It would not run on gasoline but on electricity. It would pick people up from stops and drop them off for a fee. It would also go into smaller developments to pick people up like an Uber would, but more environmentally friendly."
2375,5,241,['transportation'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
2376,5,241,['transportation'],A new transportation system.... Self driving cars/ trolleys (absolutely no tracks or special lanes for the trolley just self driving)
2377,5,241,['transportation'],A new trolley system with free transportation would be beneficial since the neighborhood isn't very big and it would do well for people who could be handicap. I think the new trolley system could be hybrid -- electric and gas -- which most trolleys aren't.
2378,5,241,['transportation'],"A new type of transportation in my area would be like a double decker bus, but more levels. There would be different areas for kids, a lounge area, an elevator that would take you do the different levels. You would pay a monthly fee and it would have a path where it would make stops. Not just a mode of transporation, but a fun transportation where you can relax and interact with people at the same time."
2379,5,241,['transportation'],A new way of transportation that will change how you commute. This innovation will make commuting fun and will reduce your stress of traveling.
2380,5,241,['transportation'],A public taxi system dedicated to public transportation.  Standard operating hours and funded through taxes.  On demand pick up via city based app.  Essentially eliminating everyday drivers.
2381,5,241,['transportation'],A quantum teleportation device that creates a temporary rip in space time that allows the users in instantly transport to any 3 dimensional coordinates in the universe. You would simply place the device on the ground and stand on it with both feet then press a remote button in your hand to start the transportation process.
2382,5,241,['transportation'],A service where you can easily pick up a ride to ublic transportation. many people live in areas where public transportation is just slighlty out of reach. this would allow people to get there in an easy an inexpensive manner.
2383,5,241,['transportation'],A ship that takes you around town within minutes and costs less than other methods of transportation.
2384,5,241,['transportation'],"A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
2385,5,241,['transportation'],"A system of neighborhood drivers who form a cooperative and use their own vehicles to provide transportation services. We live in a community of 1875 people in a rural area, it may not be practical, but it is doable."
2386,5,241,['transportation'],A transportation Idea I have is to have networked building walkways. Think of it like your average street crossing but instead of connecting streets it connects neighboring buildings instead. There would be no access to private buildings but pedestrians would be able to walk enclosed walkways running through special areas in the building to get to the next. I think this idea is very practical in heavy urban areas and would be a refreshing change from the average commute.
2387,5,241,['transportation'],"A transportation system would include wide use of self-driving cars to facilitate efficiency and safety. Cars may be privately owned, or there may be a pay-as-you go or contract type system if you do not wish to own a vehicle. There would also be a total bike lane system for those who prefer to ride bicycles. The bike lanes would be much safer than what exists now."
2388,5,241,['transportation'],"A trolley system would be a great source of transportation, using small trolleys instead of buses.  Another Idea would be a mini bus system that primarily transported people to key areas like the train station or the airport.  A shuttle system."
2389,5,241,['transportation'],A trolly/tram type of transportation!
2390,5,241,['transportation'],"A tube system, similar to how you can send packages through tubes in factories, get people in tubes. Futurama has a concept like this, but this could be somewhat realistic. It could go pretty far and be good for the environment. It would require a better infrastructure but it would make going long distances without public transportation a viable option. Unless you consider this public trans."
2391,5,241,['transportation'],"A well established public transport system, like subway, will ease the transportation problem. It will save energy and make fewer cars on the road."
2392,5,241,['transportation'],All vehicles are electric. Anyone who wishes to purchase an electric moped will receive a yearly rebate to reward them for purchasing a smaller mode of transportation that is environmentally friendly and won't congest the roads quite as much.
2393,5,241,['transportation'],"An alternate transportation system in my neighborhood would be a free transportation system that can take you anywhere that you like. Paying for transportation is not easy since everybody carries debit or credit cards nowadays. Hardly anybody has change or cash on them. Free transportation would be great, and it should be something other than a bus. It should just be a regular vehicle as well with a friendly driver to take you somewhere."
2394,5,241,['transportation'],An alternative transportation mode would be if we could tie cables along metal poles and pull ourselves where we're going using skates.
2395,5,241,['transportation'],"An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
2396,5,241,['transportation'],"An app that worked somewhat like Uber, but is for ride-sharing/car pooling.  You put in your destination, whether you can drive or not, what time you need to be to your destination, and an acceptable range for the location.  The app would look for others with similar destinations or destinations en-route for others as well as the best route to minimize drive time, but maximize people getting to their destination.  Then the app would calculate a fair percentage of the ride cost for each person based on their destination, travel distance, etc.  Public transportation here isn't great because we are so spread out.  After each ride you could rate other passengers and the driver and those ratings could be used to filter out bad users entirely or just below a certain rating level."
2397,5,241,['transportation'],"An expansion of the skyrail or a similar system with connection to the skyrail could be added to the surrounding cities of Seattle. The addition of public transportation would cut pollution and reduce traffic congestion with the plus side of convenience. It would be a good idea to implement this idea while we still have space available, rather than wait until the problem is a burden."
2398,5,241,['transportation'],An idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood would be to use cars with automated driving that would allow the person(s) to input the destination and go about doing other things while the car drove itself to that location.
2399,5,241,['transportation'],"An overhead puppy cart system, the same concept as in skii resorts. I live in NYC, and outside of traveling by train, there are no other practicals transportation which avoids traffic. Unlike the the train system, you would be able to make direct routes, with a bonus of great views around the city"
2400,5,241,['transportation'],An underground hi speed railway for fast transportation.
2401,5,241,['transportation'],"An underground Seqway track which will take a while to build but will be extremely beneficial. There are no turns as underground paths are completely straight. Recharger stations are at every mile or two. There are practically no intersections or traffic lights except at major hubs, which are few and far between. Delivery services such as mail and UPS are a major component of this transportation system, which will make them faster and clear up traffic on major roads."
2402,5,241,['transportation'],"Another idea for a new transportation system would be a magnetic bullet train system, similar to the one they have in Japan. It would be a national rail system built over the old railroads we have now. It would go to every major city in America and would take half the time to do so."
2403,5,241,['transportation'],Any type of hoover mode of transportation allowing driver to avoid accidents and hoover past slow moving traffic.
2404,5,241,['transportation'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
2405,5,241,['transportation'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
2406,5,241,['transportation'],"Chicago - Chicago has a great system and phenomenal public transport. As far as transportation though I wish the highways in the city acted like slotted cars, similar to trains in which in every highway entrance there would be a dedicated lane/railway for vehicles to travel at fast speeds like trains. This would reduce traffic and travel times."
2407,5,241,['transportation'],"Companies should use some of their advertising budget to provide rides to certain places.  This would double as advertising for that company, so they would not lose out on money and we could get unique transportation for several untapped routes, especially if it is discovered that a lot of people are traveling outside of their usual living area, like for a special event.  The companies could create specialized buses so that several people can ride, and can put their logo on the outside of the bus and could name the transportation something catchy using the company name so that word-of-mouth provides extra advertising."
2408,5,241,['transportation'],"Currently, I live in a small town that has a public transportation system. However, you have to call and wait for the bus to pick you up, instead of waiting at a pre-determined stop, and it can take forever to get where you're going. I propose a busing system that's like the one in bigger cities for my neighborhood. People could still call and wait for a bus, but buses should also stop and pick people up at predetermined stops at regular intervals."
2409,5,241,['transportation'],"Currently, my city is very underserved by the public transportation system. I believe that the existing public transit should be expanded with a greater fleet of buses, so that all people in my community could be served. The buses currently in operation only reach about half (if that) of the city's occupants, leaving many without an opportunity to get where they need to go quickly and affordably."
2410,5,241,['transportation'],"Drones.  They are on the cutting edge of technology.  Amazon is going to implement them.  I think sending drones to go pick up your dry cleaning or your groceries would be very attractive to a great number of people.  It will be the future of transportation of goods.  You can pilot your own drone, or you can have a drone for each store.  You rent one from the dry cleaners, the grocery store, etc.  They are pre-programmed to travel their flight path and the people at the store load 'em up and send them back home to you.  This is perfect especially in cold weather or snowy areas."
2411,5,241,['transportation'],"Electromagnetic transportation would be an innovative way to travel. I am thinking more so on the side of  ""being green"". Imagine a bus or railway style vessel that moves along a track with the force of magnets. It would eliminate the need for gas or diesel."
2412,5,241,['transportation'],Environment friendly transportation can be used to avoid global warming . So i prefer Electric trains and electric based vehicles .
2413,5,241,['transportation'],Firefighters are using jet-packs in Dubai to combat fires in skyscrapers. I propose we use jet-packs for personal transport. It's hard enough to travel in big cities like Miami with all the traffic. Having your own jet pack allows you to literally fly away from a stressful situation such as sitting in traffic or waiting for public transportation. It will save time and is fun. This futuristic technology is here and it works.
2414,5,241,['transportation'],"flying transportation system will be very famous in future for example flying car, flying scatter board bike and so"
2415,5,241,['transportation'],"For transportation in my neighborhood we have cars, and buses. The most popular mode of transportation being the four door family sedan type car. Following that it's the minivan and then the four-door trucks. They can be seen whizzing back and forth on the roads causing many traffic jams during peak morning hours."
2416,5,241,['transportation'],"From small towns to big cities, public transportation is helping to generate new vitality like never

before. Beautiful, walkable town squares combine residential, retail, office, recreation and public

transportation features to make community living easy. New bus services and light rail extensions

improve mobility and ease congestion. Even the smallest adjustments, like widening sidewalks and

adding bikeways, can provide dramatic impact and value."
2417,5,241,['transportation'],"Future cityscapes will be re-designed in such a fashion where all transportation will be as efficient as possible, through grouping all businesses, schools, hospitals, etc. together in different districts/areas. All transportation will be through public modalities, no private modes of transportation will exist."
2418,5,241,['transportation'],Future transportation in my neighborhood would be by air. Cars will travel in the air and park on top of roof buildings. Gas would not cost that much and it will be less crowed on the streets.
2419,5,241,['transportation'],Future transportation is the Shower transporter. You get ready for where you want to go and then simply hop in the shower and press a button to be teleported to your pre-progammed destination. E.g. you will have regular places like your work and supermarket already programmed in with addresses. The shower will pop out through your roof and drop you off at your destination by taking the sky-way and then return home. Just remember to take your shower calling watch with you to buzz your shower teleport back when you want to return home. No more traffic no more waiting no more parking just flying showers :)
2420,5,241,['transportation'],Future transportation system in my neighborhood could be a electric bicycle taxi system where neighborhood resents can take shorts trips like the grocery store or sending kids off to school.
2421,5,241,['transportation'],Future transportation will be cleaner and more environmentally freindly. Cars will run on less fuel and will have better emissions
2422,5,241,['transportation'],Give people segways or hoverboards and then have a transport for those smaller transportations methods. Sort of like a car-carrier or bus that you board with your segway or hoverboard.
2423,5,241,['transportation'],"Gyroscopic personal vehicles. These devices would generate a magnetic field in opposition with the earth's magnetic field, creating levitation and allowing for free and easy transportation."
2424,5,241,['transportation'],"Handicapped taxi. Public transportation is awful in my area, so if you are in a wheelchair then you need an expensive handicapped van just to be able to get around. Some taxi wheelchair van options would be great for people who can't afford a $30,000 wheelchair van and might otherwise have a hard time getting around."
2425,5,241,['transportation'],Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
2426,5,241,['transportation'],"Have a transportation system in the city where there is a tunneling system filled miniature train with small passenger capacity. These miniature trains can take people directly to their destination and the best part is that because they are small, there can be a large number of them running underneath the city."
2427,5,241,['transportation'],"Having some sort of electric train that runs underground, just like the subway system in New York. The city that I currently live in doesn't have that option so having some sort of underground transportation system that runs all around the city constantly would make commuting much better for everyone."
2428,5,241,['transportation'],Hover boards would be a great way for people to get from place to place while not using gas. They can charge it the night before and have it last all day without fail. Monthly cleaning will be needed. Not only would it save from using gas it will be the most popular form of transportation out there.
2429,5,241,['transportation'],Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.
2430,5,241,['transportation'],"I am from Cincinnati, and one new mode of transportation that would be great here is a subway system. Tunnels already exist from a failed project decades ago, but with the growth the city has seen, it could be a viable option."
2431,5,241,['transportation'],"I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
2432,5,241,['transportation'],I believe a good future transportation system for my city would be a highspeed lightrail that can get people to their stop quickly and completely safely
2433,5,241,['transportation'],"I can imagine a speedbus being a new form of transportation.  It can have its own lane or tracks, and go as fast or faster than a train."
2434,5,241,['transportation'],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
2435,5,241,['transportation'],"I don't anticipate the transportation system changing too much in my area no matter the time frame. I think the car will rule for the next several decades, but I would like the cars to change. They need not be so huge, and would be powered by plug-in type electrical engines. Each home would have a solar array and this would power your home, and your car. A back-up natural gas power plant would help out if it's cloudy for weeks. Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
2436,5,241,['transportation'],"I envision a new transportation system where we use old school busses to transport people to work.  The busses should be turned into green vehicles electric, hybrid or the like."
2437,5,241,['transportation'],I feel the best is a transportation tunnel.  It should run around 150 miles per hour and provide food accommodations as well as sleeping areas!
2438,5,241,['transportation'],"I have no problem visualizing a new mode of transportation in my neighborhood. Years ago coal trains ran behind my house and the old gully is still there where the tracks were. Would love to see them back again, but it will never happen."
2439,5,241,['transportation'],"I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
2440,5,241,['transportation'],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
2441,5,241,['transportation'],"I imagine a kind of moving walkway in the sky.  The moving walkway would be built on stilts above the ground. An individual can hop on the moving walkway and can walk to another part of the city, but at a faster rate than normal walking. This would encourage taking our own two feet as transportation."
2442,5,241,['transportation'],I imagine a transportation system in which we all use underground super chutes. They move us from place to place within our town super fast. It would have to be set up so everything is safe of course. I imagine a network of these chutes spreading throughout the city and they pop you up wherever you want to go. Wouldn't that be amazing?
2443,5,241,['transportation'],I imagine a way to ride a school bus to various spots on its route. You would be pre-screened as an adult who could act as a school bus monitor and at the same time gain transportation to a location near the school. It would solve the problem of kids riding unsupervised and give another public transportation option in the neighborhood.
2444,5,241,['transportation'],I imagine people using hoverboards and personal flying vehicles for transportation in the future. Personal helicopters specifically and hoverboards similar to the ones in back to the future.
2445,5,241,['transportation'],"I live in a pretty population dense area where most things people need (like a hospital, a big job center, homes, grocery store) are pretty close to each other.  I think this set up begs for a monorail.  It would be elevated so wouldn't interfere with current traffic too much, but would provide a nice transportation system for people to take for short trips."
2446,5,241,['transportation'],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town. I can see the current roads changing to smaller lanes made for electric vehicles while most of the transportation needs will be fulfilled with bike and walking paths and personal hoverboard type of transportation.
2447,5,241,['transportation'],"I live in an area where there are a lot of senior citizens so driving can sometimes be scary, and I think this city would greatly benefit from public transportation. However, I think something that would benefit the environment would be the most helpful, so I think pushcarts would be a lot of fun, or even horse drawn carriages. Not only would these be better for the environment, but I think the older people would appreciate the old-fashioned nature of such public transport systems."
2448,5,241,['transportation'],"I live in NYC. Travel is not too difficult, with the only real concern being the price of a subway ticket or a taxi ride. With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue. I believe that since the roads and the undergrounds are already full, the only real option is to expand transportation above ground, such as on rails between buildings. This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem."
2449,5,241,['transportation'],"I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
2450,5,241,['transportation'],I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
2451,5,241,['transportation'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
2452,5,241,['transportation'],I think a form of public transportation could be an electric type of subway that runs on a non intrusive track layed into the pavment much like a train track. It could be shaped like a normal subway but on the roof space there would be solar panels to generate electricity needed to run. Any remaining power needed could be provided by the tracks.
2453,5,241,['transportation'],"I think a good idea will be to use electric cycles instead of a bike or a car in metros. They not only help in decreasing pollution as well as motivating people towards physical exercises.



A proper network of e cycles and connected to a main frame can be seen as a new transportation system emerging. Moreover this can also be used as a public transportation system by constructing cycle stands where they can be charged and the cost of public transport can be paid in the machine."
2454,5,241,['transportation'],"I think a good idea will be to use electric cycles instead of a bike or a car in metros. They not only help in decreasing pollution as well as motivating people towards physical exercises.

2456,5,241,['transportation'],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
2457,5,241,['transportation'],"I think a method that would improve the transportation system would be to change how turn lanes are handled in America. Overseas, to turn left, you veer off to a lane on the right that comes to a stop so that you don't block traffic waiting to turn and then when it is clear, you drive across the street onto the road you were going to turn onto."
2458,5,241,['transportation'],I think a new transportation that utilizes a type of rail system on the sidewalks that people can easily easily walk throughout the neighborhood - similar to the moving walkways at airports.  Sort of like a conveyor belt for people.
2459,5,241,['transportation'],"I think a private school bus would be a great idea. Maybe it could be the size of a SUV and fit maybe 4 to 6 kids in it comfortable. Some kids are not able to take a bus to school so parents have to take public transportation every morning to drop them off. It could be like a Uber school bus sort of, each SUV bus will have certain school on their route that they can drop kids off at."
2460,5,241,['transportation'],I think adding a rail system in my city would be a great idea. The only public transportation we have is buses and there are a lot of areas they don't even run to. So I think a rail system would do wonders in getting a lot of other people where they were going.
2461,5,241,['transportation'],"I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it. I don't think that vehicle ownership will be nearly as widespread as it is these days, as driverless cars will be far safer."
2462,5,241,['transportation'],"I think having a streetcar system would be amazing, it could be automated to accept fares, and would provide safe transportation for all."
2463,5,241,['transportation'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
2464,5,241,['transportation'],"I think that a cool new transportation system would be a bike that we all pedal. It would be a long bike, maybe 5-8 seats long on each side. It would start with one rider who will then ride to other people's houses to pick others up. They would get on the bike and start peddling to pick the next person up."
2465,5,241,['transportation'],"I think that a new mod of transportation in my neighborhood would be a electric bike taxi system. It would be an electric bike pulling a carriage that hold up to 3 other people. The system will travel from people's houses to their work place, local shopping centers and local entertainment places."
2466,5,241,['transportation'],"I think that one cool idea is to have personal transportation that allows you to connect with other people in your area so you can rideshare and also carpool or get a ride when needed. Instead of using like Craigslist to ask for rideshare or ask if people are willing to pick  them up, you use an app. People can sign into this app and then say which direction they are going. Along the way you can request that person pick you up to get you from A to B...kind of like hitchhiking through a mobile app."
2467,5,241,['transportation'],"I think we could have carpool vans that schedule drop offs for us in the city which could save gas and promote a green clean transportation system. Also, we could take turns as drivers, with GPS equipped and a convertible top for sunny days."
2468,5,241,['transportation'],I thinking of transportation that you can transport yourself through your mind.  It would be through dreams that are real.
2469,5,241,['transportation'],"I want an elevated railway that preserves nature, resists going down during snow and bad weather, and reaches all areas of my city. It would be public transportation and have low-cost monthly passes. It would also run on renewable, clean energy."
2470,5,241,['transportation'],"I was thinking of underground tunnels that you could access from certain points -- not for a subway. Instead, you get in the tunnels and you have the option to take various tunnels to certain destinations using your preferred mode of transportation: razor scooter, roller-blades, running/walking. You can check out a scooter at an entrance, drop it off at your destination. that way you never have to bring it with you, the entrances would have them on hand. or you can just run/walk if you want and it would be out of the cold/hot/rain/snow/sun, etc..."
2471,5,241,['transportation'],"I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
2472,5,241,['transportation'],"I wish we had separate bicycle highways that were enclosed spaces, both heated and cooled for summer/winter. It would be a cheaper mode of transportation. There would be protection to prevent car vs bicycle accident, a major problem in our area. It would also be healthier and exercise for the day during a commute. I picture it being a rounded space that is clear so you can see your surroundings outside."
2473,5,241,['transportation'],I would enjoy having a limousine service in the neighborhood. That would be a safe and comfortable mode of transportation.
2474,5,241,['transportation'],i would enjoy seeing horses as a way of public transportation more often
2475,5,241,['transportation'],I would imagine an electric scooter or hoverboard rental system.  You could use them when going to and from a train station stop and to your final destination.  I imagine a rental system so that you could pick one up at a train or bus station to go your extra distance and return it when you return.  Renting would be a good option if you did not have your own with you or only use it with other public transportation. Bad weather is always an issue using these devices.
2476,5,241,['transportation'],"I would l to see a system of transportation where the service would do home pickups,similar to a bus, only the stops would be made at your home regularly for a monthly or yearly fee."
2477,5,241,['transportation'],I would like a non-gas mode of transportation to be created for our area such as a horse drawn carriage where the horses are treated really well but they also go fast and get us where we need to go.
2478,5,241,['transportation'],I would like to imagine being able to create a app and that uses credit cards. and invent a motorcycle scooter that has a huge row of seats in the back and runs like a mini van and use it as a taxi service. for only the city that I live in and name it Go Scooter transportation.
2479,5,241,['transportation'],"I would like to see a bicycle highway.  It would go the length of regular highways, but be for bikes and pedestrians.  It should be wide enough for fast moving road cyclist, it should have passing lanes, and little road crossings.  There should be frequent on and off ramps.  There should also be many large parking areas.  Ideally it would even lead to public transportation areas with ample bike parking."
2480,5,241,['transportation'],"I would like to see a public transportation system, funded by the government and running non-stop.  Possibly employing people in an uber style privately owned vehicle service.  Or some car pool ideas."
2481,5,241,['transportation'],"I would like to see a transportation system that can be used for professional reasons, or personal, but not both."
2482,5,241,['transportation'],"I would like to see an advanced transportation system that involved driverless cars.  The idea is the same as using a taxi but without a driver.  Like Uber, you would use your mobile device to order a car and control the experience.  The car shows up at your door, takes you to your destination and you are billed for the ride. It would save me thousands of dollars in the cost to own, maintain, insure and license my own personal car."
2483,5,241,['transportation'],"I would like to see public transportation on buses expanded in my area, with a dedicated area for bicycles to also be transported on the buses.  This would help a lot with traffic, and still allow people to get to their destinations quickly."
2484,5,241,['transportation'],I would like to see rocket skates as a transportation method. They might need something to help people keep balance but they would be fun to use and practical for some peoples lifestyle.
2485,5,241,['transportation'],"I would love it if the city made walking and riding a bike more user friendly. There are no areas that are safe for pedestrians or bikers. If there were a bike lane, more people could move independently and get to where they are going. Commuters using more than one mode of transportation would be able to get to their destinations more quickly and with greater safety."
2486,5,241,['transportation'],I would say the biggest way to improve innovating is to have all new construction be made in regards to current public transporation hub and those that cnanot be require them to build a public transportation hub. So all new communities have bus access or train access.
2487,5,241,['transportation'],"I'd love to see a crowdsourced method of alternate transportation in my city, where people could request rides from others who happen to be in the area and going the direction you need to with a minimal cost. There are so many people who have cars and it would be a great option for people who don't have reliable access to one. It could use cell phone apps and perhaps even have a traditional component using telephone for people who are less technologically inclined. The biggest challenge would be safety/security, and I'm honestly not sure how to overcome that aspect. There could be specific stops, almost like bus stops, where people could gather and wait for rides, or schedule rides to pick them up at certain times."
2488,5,241,['transportation'],"If we could be so technologically advanced to create giant versions of the airport conveyor belts where humans are carried across, that would be my new method of transportation. Since people are mostly lazy and want something to do the work for them (hence the upcoming popularity of the hands-free segway), this would be perfect to eliminate at least a fourth of the traffic on the street from cars."
2489,5,241,['transportation'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
2490,5,241,['transportation'],"In my city, it is almost impossible to not having a car since the public transportation is not that good. However, car ownership can be quite expensive. Car sharing could reduce the cost of having a car, we can build a system that anyone can use a ""public"" car that can be shared after paying a certain fixed cost up-front and hourly/daily rate afterward."
2491,5,241,['transportation'],In my neighborhood I think the best type of transportation system would be an elevated railway like a tram at disney world it would make commuting between neighboring cities far easier and the technology would make commutes more timely.
2492,5,241,['transportation'],"In my neighborhood, any kind of public transportation would be innovative. Due to the apparent stigma of such, I would propose a lovely electric-run ""uber coach"" instead of the big ugly city bus. This could be as simple as a mini-van and could deliver us suffering commuters of Southern California from a few select and regular pick-up spots to bigger, car-pool mega spots at various freeway points."
2493,5,241,['transportation'],"In my neighborhood, any public transportation would  be new. We could make rentable bicycles that are in a convenient location"
2494,5,241,['transportation'],In the city i live in there is no public transportation. If some rails or buses could be brought in it could help a lot of people here.
2495,5,241,['transportation'],"In the future, there will be electric powered vehicle system. There will be transportation centers with different sized vehicles for rent for a small fee. The vehicles will range in size from one person scooters to six person vehicles. They will be rented on an hourly basis."
2496,5,241,['transportation'],It would be cool (although pretty difficult to actually create) to have a gondola lift public transportation system that had cars that could travel over the streets and take people places avoiding traffic! There'd be stops that had elevators and stairs to get up to them and basically they'd just be suspended a bit above the streets and you could travel nicely between them over all the traffic below.
2497,5,241,['transportation'],"It would be great if we could improve the pubic transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road. I would like to see self driving buses as well as bus only lanes and self driving cars. No manually controlled cars would be allowed and because of this hopefully the roads will be safer because most accidents and caused by human error. We could have the speed limits increased as well because self driving cars can ""see"" a lot father ahead than humans."
2498,5,241,['transportation'],"It would have to be something that is a hybrid that helps the environment where when you get into it it's propelled by recycled human waste.   I know it sounds a little weird but if you realize how much of it there is it would be awesome to get the benefits of those of a botanist in outer space for instance like in the movie ""The Marsian"" and apply it to car transportation."
2499,5,241,['transportation'],"it'd be cool to have a rent a shop throughout the city for people who aren't able to afford bicycles or scooters, or any other sort of transportations. the can rent an item, and return it at the other part of town."
2500,5,241,['transportation'],"Larger Vehicles for apps like Uber that set up car pool for large amounts of people that are going to the same area. For example in Austin, Texas many people enjoy 6th straight but struggle to find parking. If apps like uber could set up their own busses or larger vehicles for transportation to places like 6th street or concerts/ sports arenas it would be much more efficient than a bus that makes regular stops."
2501,5,241,['transportation'],"Lets try non mechanical modes of transportation instead we either walk or ride an animal from place to place.  The animal can be any type such as elephant, horse, donkey, camel, and maybe you can train something a bit faster."
2502,5,241,['transportation'],"Luxury busses, nicer busses for people who don't want to own a car but want nicer transportation than what you get from a public bus experience"
2503,5,241,['transportation'],Make public transportation fares partially/fully state or local tax credits or deductible
2504,5,241,['transportation'],Man-Hole Transportation : Replicating current sewage/water underground tunnels to port people easily. People can stand on the man-hole and will be pulled down and then ported by the tunnel.
2505,5,241,['transportation'],"My city is right on the ocean and there are many canals within the city as well, so I think a kind of transportation system with water taxis or some kind of water buses would be really useful. In a lot of cases I think this kind of transportation would be faster and more accessible to people, especially if it was willing to pick people up at designated locations or even right off their own docks for those who have them."
2506,5,241,['transportation'],"My idea alternative transportation in the neighborhood would be horseback. There would be nice safe wide equestrian trails throughout allowing you to visit neighbors, go to the convenience or grocery store which would have hitching posts. Motorized vehicles would be limited to passenger cars/trucks."
2507,5,241,['transportation'],"My idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood is a series of really big tubes, with padding, and occasionally air holes, with mesh filters to prevent bugs and large debris from getting in.  The tubes would be places alongside all the streets, and be at a constant forward vacuum, with enough lessening of suction to allow people to grasp a handle at their stop and get out.   (If you miss your stop, you just ride around until it comes up again, pushing yourself towards the right tube as it comes towards you.)



Collision between travelers would need to be solved, as well as how to clean up any errant body fluids left by travelers; perhaps a daily purge at midnight, where the suction could be increased exponentially and all materials dumped in a pile, on a rotating schedule, on different people's lawns.   



This system has the benefit of a very low carbon footprint, and lends itself well to spontaneous exclamations of 'cowabunga'.  



Implementation note: This idea may require anti-gravity research, in addition to a lot of suction."
2508,5,241,['transportation'],"My idea for public transportation would include an underground rail system powered by magnets. Because of the varied climate as well as prevalence natural disasters in my area, having the system underground seems like the best idea. The train would stop a lot more often than normal trains; At the end of every street at least. It would have a separate exit system in order to not lose quite as much time loading and unloading passengers."
2509,5,241,['transportation'],My idea is a telephone that automatically locks itself down so that when you are in transport via car or any other mode of transportation it cannot be used until it detects you are no longer in transport.
2510,5,241,['transportation'],My idea is having double decker buses to accommodate more people in public transportation.
2511,5,241,['transportation'],"My mode of alternative transportation would include cars, buses, and trams running on solar energy in roadways. I'm unsure how it would work exactly, but if we could harness the power of the sun and build vehicles that have the panels either on them or in the tires it could remove the use of fossil fuels."
2512,5,241,['transportation'],"My neighborhood currently has no bike lanes, so I would imagine a system with renewable transportation integrated into the layout. Spaces for bikes, electric car re-charging stations, etc."
2513,5,241,['transportation'],"my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops. People will be able to travel to any part of the world without going through airports and flight connections. There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
2514,5,241,['transportation'],My neighborhood has no transportation system. So a simple bus would help.
2515,5,241,['transportation'],"My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
2516,5,241,['transportation'],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
2517,5,241,['transportation'],My new transportation system would be a golf cart system. We have many elderly people who would enjoy being able to get around using golf carts. It would be a wa around the city without having to use the highway.
2518,5,241,['transportation'],"My town is in desparate need of a form of public transportation. Everyone is reliant on a car or scooter. I think they don't have enough need to  warrant a bus route, but I'm in favor of widening the tiny bicycle lanes they have."
2519,5,241,['transportation'],My transportation idea would be using technology to make car sharing more accessible. Such as a phone application. It would be cheaper than using lyft or uber.
2520,5,241,['transportation'],"My transportation suggestion (in my town) would be to avoid the freeways and allow me to get to work using a rail way-type system.  This would be either underground or overground.  This is not an something that we see on the west coast a lot, so it would be very helpful to many commuters in the town I live."
2521,5,241,['transportation'],"My transportation system would be for people to enter their own personal, flying car. The destination would be put into the onboard computer. And then the flying car would automatically proceed on the matrix."
2522,5,241,['transportation'],"New idea, trains that fly.  This would combine two existing means of transportation into one futuristic flight fantasy! A train would travel as usual and then be picked up by a plane.  This way a train car could travel faster and then be dropped back off on its final stop by the plane."
2523,5,241,['transportation'],"One day per month (at least) cars should be banned from the roads. Some buses could be allowed to allow for transportation of people who can't walk or bike, but this would be a great way to encourage human-powered transport and allow people to see the fun in this activity without increased danger from car traffic.  This would also be great for the environment."
2524,5,241,['transportation'],"One Idea I've always had was sky trams. It would operate just like your traditional tram system but instead of a point A to point B ride. You would have an additional 5 to 10 stops on a linear path, to support the stops I would use a magnetic rail system, instead of the old wire cable system. This would cut down on over crowding in terms of public and private transportation."
2525,5,241,['transportation'],"Our future transportation will be in the form of spacecraft transporting to and from space pods. We may have our homes as they are now, but we will also have pods in space to use."
2526,5,241,['transportation'],"Our new transportation system would involve golf carts.  Several roads would be designated as golf-cart-only areas and include parking.  New paths could be created because they take up less space than normal roads and even designated lanes on existing roads could be defined to use existing infrastructure.  The environment would be healthier with less pollutants, crowding would be less due to smaller size vehicles, and it would even encourage healthier lifestyles out in the air and sunshine."
2527,5,241,['transportation'],"Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."
2528,5,241,['transportation'],"People not owning private vehicles, but could summon a vehicle for use though a computer or smartphone to their location. The vehicle would take them where they need to go. All of the vehicles would be electrical and green friendly. The vehicle might take you to another form of transportation if the software determined that a train would be more appropriate."
2529,5,241,['transportation'],"Public skype/facetime stations in major transportation hubs (bus or train stations, airports)."
2530,5,241,['transportation'],"Public transportation should be free a few times per month -- maybe one weekend day or holiday, and one working day.  This will cause less people to drive and improve the environment, and bring in more transportation money to the city.  Also, it would urge people to tell their elected officials to improve public transportation so that they can take advantage of it more."
2531,5,241,['transportation'],"Public transportation that may have a few bikes on the front that you can borrow/rent. Having the bikes attached to public transportation could help you to go further and maybe get around another city that has other things to offer, other than your own, where you may use the bikes at hand."
2532,5,241,['transportation'],"Public transportation would be ran on hybrid engines, that would be better for emissions, and far more fuel efficient. Future transportation would be far more fuel efficient that runs on alternate forms of power, rather than fossil fuels such as gasoline. These new vehicles would rely less on the oil resource and be cleaner, and far more efficient than before."
2533,5,241,['transportation'],"Public, foot-based transportation. Something like the automatic walkways in airports, but for long stretches of large cities, particularly between common high-traffic areas. It would probably be best if the walkways were raised, to avoid conflict with other ground traffic. It must also include access for the disabled, be easy enough for even tech-fearful users, and extremely safe (with monitored auto-shutoff where applicable)."
2534,5,241,['transportation'],quattrocycle would be great idea for transportation whithout spending any type of gas !!
2535,5,241,['transportation'],"Railway tunnels off of the highways (outdoor subways) to provide a fast paced mode of transportation on busy streets that work with a system like uber that will have drivers readily available at each location. More for suburban areas, not large city areas that have subway/rail systems."
2536,5,241,['transportation'],"School Bus taxi. School buses rumble down our street every day, often not every seat is taken. If you knew the route, and had been vetted through security, you could pay a small fare to hop on and ride along the route, even connecting to other school buses. It would be an energy-efficient mode of transportation. Also, more adults on the bus would probably reduce bullying among the kids."
2537,5,241,['transportation'],Scooter would be great transportation for college kids and busy cities.
2538,5,241,['transportation'],Some kind of public transportation like light rail that goes nearby would be ideal. If we could have a light rail or subway system that connects the city to the suburbs that would greatly improve the traffic situation.
2539,5,241,['transportation'],"Something above the streets, an elevated form of public transportation, would be cool. That way it would be out of the traffic."
2540,5,241,['transportation'],Something akin to a streetcar or trolley bus system could be very useful in my city.  It would have its own designated lane and be a useful public transportation alternative.
2541,5,241,['transportation'],Subway that takes you straight to downtown. It would be the best transportation to get to downtown without any traffic to watch football games get to work and other activities. I think a lot more people would be traveling this way.
2542,5,241,['transportation'],"Take the train  to its nearest destination  to your destination.  Get off the train, and rent a bike or scooter to take you to your exact location.  Drop off the bike there, and it's waiting for you for your return trip to the train.  Monthly passes cover all types of transportation and cards are used for bus, train, bike and scooter use."
2543,5,241,['transportation'],"Telepads! The Transportation of the Future! Simply step on this portal pad, and you are instantly transported to your location! The movement of molecules into energy is completely safe, and many users only experience a minor burning sensation for a minute after the teleportation process. Forget flying cars, late trains or other outdated modes of transport, and tele away with Telepads!"
2544,5,241,['transportation'],THE ALTERNATIVE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS VERY USEFUL TO TRANSPORT ALL THE PRODUCTS AND ITS TIME SAVING
2545,5,241,['transportation'],the best transportation where i live is a personal car. it is the fastest and most convenient for the type of city i live in.
2546,5,241,['transportation'],"The cat bus is a new public transportation system where riders get to interact with 2 or more cats! The cats will be in cages, but they will be larger cages so they have room to roam. There will also be an enclosed cage where the cats who are too excited from the social stimulation can be alone."
2547,5,241,['transportation'],The future of transportation in my city is by having self-automated driverless cars. They would reduce the amount of traffic congestion and reduce the number of car accidents.
2548,5,241,['transportation'],"The future of transportation is advancing rapidly but we still can't figure out how to end the fatalities that come with driving, but now with virtual reality gaming in effect they have finally announced a new app and means of transportation that allows you to have the ability to travel without even leaving your home. All you do is download the app, put on the goggles, enter the destination and you will travel to any location just like that. No, no, what you are thinking is time traveling, that's crazy, time traveling does not exist, what this is, is just a portal built to take you to your location without having to worry about the outside world. Don't worry it will be available for everyone so don't worry about it costing you an arm and a leg, well a few have lost arms but that was just the early testings."
2549,5,241,['transportation'],"The future transportation system in me neighborhood is going to consist of driverless vehicles that hover and travel with the help of magnetism. The vehicles have built in solar panels that operate throughout the city 24/7. These vehicles all have routines they follow everyday so people just have to transfer according to where they want to go. On the other hand, if people want to own their own vehicle then it is possible. They can travel where ever they want to and all they have to do is to recharge their solar battery in the sunlight."
2550,5,241,['transportation'],"The future transportation system in my neighborhood is called air cars. They were created in an effort to reduce carbon footprints and try to save our planet. These vehicles are much more lighter than regular cars and can be upgraded to fly. The best thing about these cars is that they operate solely on air. What is even better is that there is a filter that intakes air and cleans it by trapping dirty air in a compartment only able to be removed by manufacturers. This is our last ditch effort to save the Earth, so buy a Clean Car."
2551,5,241,['transportation'],The future transportation system in my neighborhood would possibly incorporate traffic light systems that would detect the amount of traffic and flow to better keep traffic moving and prevent long lines and wait times at intersections therefor reducing trip times and automobile emissions.
2552,5,241,['transportation'],"The man used his old, used car for transportation every day to drive to work and back to his house."
2553,5,241,['transportation'],"The mode of transportation that I would imagine would be no different than an average city street. However, with the right conductors placed under the street the friction created by people's feet as they walked would supply supplemental power to the city. As such a person could get a ""walker"" designation that they could either receive some incentive for (pay or reduced taxes). This would get people more active and save the governemtn money and reduce environmental damage (through the waste of resources and nuclear power)."
2554,5,241,['transportation'],"The new transportation in my neighborhood is by teleportation! There will be a number of discs on the floor, coated in white paint, that people will step on and be teleported to wherever they would like to be. There is a catch - you have to do jumping jacks to get the teleporter started!"
2555,5,241,['transportation'],"The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
2556,5,241,['transportation'],The terrain where I live can make public transportation hard to develop. It is very hilly. There is a main highway/route that runs straight enough that a rail system could work. It would be good to get people to the more populated section that could then hook up easily with other modes of public transportation (which do not exist right now but it could be done). It would not be high speed as there would need to be several stops along the way. It could be done with an electric source that would not be harmful for pollution.
2557,5,241,['transportation'],"The transportation system in my neighborhood consists of each person driving their own cars. Occasionally, people will carpool, but there is no public transportation and walking is not feasable."
2558,5,241,['transportation'],"The transportation system is much into the future where you get into a cylinder and press your destination on the buttons, somewhat like an elevator. The tube launches and within minutes, you arrive at your destination within the city limits. The cylinder, if you can imagine, is one like what you put your deposits in at a bank window."
2559,5,241,['transportation'],The transportation system would be a combination of roads with cars and a railroad track. All of the cars would be connected and be able to drive themselves. Cars would all be on tracks and controlled by the car itself. This would lower accidents and allow for better traffic. Cars would be able to accelerate much faster as there is no driver intervention and you don't have to wait for other cars to accelerate or worry about where other cars are going.
2560,5,241,['transportation'],"The transportation system would be like the sidewalks that move in the airport, you would just stand on the sidewalk and it would move you where you need to go."
2561,5,241,['transportation'],"The transportation would be efficient; it would be green and rely on newer energies that are not dependent upon fossil fuels. It also would be future-proof, such that it would reduce and combat the issues of traffic jams and collisions. We still would have private and public transportation, allowing people to make the choice of which is better for their needs. There also would be strict requirements for those who choose to drive; thus reducing the amount of likely collisions. It would be affordable and allow society to continue to grow and prosper."
2562,5,241,['transportation'],There are two different modes of transportation within my city. The first one is a car. They usually have four doors on the left and right sides of them that open outwardly. There are four wheels and windows towards the top of the vehicle for viewing. The steering gear is located in the front seat on the left hand side and is controlled by the driver.
2563,5,241,['transportation'],"There could be a train type of system but not using metal tracks like they have in europe (above ground?)  The trolley or bus could be made to target things people wanna go do instead of just transportation.  Like grocery shopping or night out to watch movie theatre and that way everyone is grouped and the businesses upsales, etc can develop better because of that."
2564,5,241,['transportation'],"There is no public transportation in my neighborhood. We do not even have sidewalks for pedestrians. It is a major problem that I wish could be fixed, but no one cares about rural cities."
2565,5,241,['transportation'],"There should be paid service for a bus route to pick up people who live right outside a city. I will use my self as an example for my idea. I live about 20 miles for a major city . If I didn't have a automobile I would not be able to get anywhere important. Now the nearest cilty has a bus route only for those in the city. But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area. The school bus service already does this , I don't know why the city could come up with a plan to offer public transportation for adults living in rural areas. It's just very stupid that this is not a thing in Houston ."
2566,5,241,['transportation'],there will be driver-less cars and a lite rail system. There will still be some (free) bus transportation to fill in the gaps and help negate the need for new roads
2567,5,241,['transportation'],"There would be a four inch tall metal rail running between the sidewalk and curb, up and down every street. There would be small carts powered with gravity batteries that would run on the rails. This would help people stop relying on fossil fuel transportation"
2568,5,241,['transportation'],These are different methods of wheeled transportation modes.
2569,5,241,['transportation'],This is a hybrid airship. Technology has developed that allows these vehicles to be more compact and use hydrogen lift cells safely. There are dozens of air ferries lifting people quietly into the air and to major cities all across America. The carbon footprint of the consumer aviation industry is drastically reduced. The noise pollution of traditional airports is all but gone. The hybrid airship is the vehicle of choice in terms of transportation.
2570,5,241,['transportation'],"This is a transportation system that delivers food directly to people's houses. It exists in a large city and people will use an App on their phones to get food delivered to their house. They can enter the restaurant, find out what they want, and someone will deliver the food item by any mean they choose whether it be car or bicycle or walking. The app will also store people's favorite orders at their restaurants so they don't have to think about what to order."
2571,5,241,['transportation'],"This new transportation system is a bullet train in the sky, able to span around the neighborhood with up to 700 passengers in under two minutes. It's sleek silver coat is never late, and always early to make sure everyone gets where they need to go. The rails float there in the sky, ready to carry this majestic beauty to the ends of the neighborhood making sure everyone is early"
2572,5,241,['transportation'],This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
2573,5,241,['transportation'],Transportation based on carts. Everyone gets on a cart that moves from street to street. It stops only briefly to let people on and off.
2574,5,241,['transportation'],"Transportation by shopping cart taxis. It's fun, it's cheap, and it'll certainly get the kids on board."
2575,5,241,['transportation'],"Transportation is mostly done by cars nowadays, but why don't we use rocket powered shoes instead? Flying with footwear is not only cool, it would be much faster than driving."
2576,5,241,['transportation'],Transportation that would allow people to rent out electric self driving cars. This would let people have cars pick them up at whatever location they want and have the car autonomously drive to their destination. Similar to a fleet of self driving electric taxis. This would greatly reduce the cost of transportation in my opinion because people would not have to buy cars but could rather rent or lease them.
2577,5,241,['transportation'],transportation vehicles
2578,5,241,['transportation'],"Transportation would not be about getting the general population from home to work and back. It would be about moving goods and services to people directly.

This will require drone technologiy so that road infrastructure could be used to get bulk items from one place to another more efficiently and faster. Public transportation should be the rule."
2579,5,241,['transportation'],"Unfortunately, I live in a very small/rural town, so future transportation system would likely be simple public bus transit."
2580,5,241,['transportation'],Use bicycles as the exclusive form of transportation. Get rid of all cars.
2581,5,241,['transportation'],using Biogas as fuel are also good innovative thing which makes goood transportation system .
2582,5,241,['transportation'],Using boats to travel in Miami to beat the rush hour traffic. It's quite simple to travel anywhere in Miami by using the canals and various waterways. Boats or ferries should be used not just for sight seeing but for public transportation.
2583,5,241,['transportation'],"Using electrics cars as the main source of transportation. By using renewable energy as a way to recharge the cars, we would dramatically change the way we use energy for the better."
2584,5,241,['transportation'],Using train and bike will be good transportation mode which reduces cost of living and be good as they wont harm atmosphere.
2585,5,241,['transportation'],We are planning to buy a battery car forthe transportation in our neighborhood. By using the battery car there will be no bad effects in our atmosphere and also it will not populated our environment.
2586,5,241,['transportation'],we have a unique opportunity to leave for the next generation a transportation system better than the one we inherited.
2587,5,241,['transportation'],We should be giving people a tax deduction for doing more walking and/or bike riding to reduce transportation in vehicles.  This applies to my city because everything is so close!
2588,5,241,['transportation'],what is needed is a tubular powered zipline based transportation system. a combination of pnewumatic and electric power will propel people from place to place in a similar manner to a ski lift except it would just be a small tube that has a chain of sorts running in it along the sidewalks. all you would have to do is to have a harness on and when you need to go to one of the destinations you hook on to the line that is color coded for your destination and cruise on down there. Not the most comfortable way to travel but the infrastructure for a neighborhood would be relatively inexpensive.
2589,5,241,['transportation'],"What we need is a better public transportation system that services the East end of the city.  Perhaps a bullet shuttle that will pick up in certain areas of the East End, and shuttle t predetermined locations within the city such as the downtown area, in addition to other areas."
2590,5,241,['transportation'],When I imagine future transportation in my neighborhood I visualize the vehicles of today with more advanced technology. I image that the vehicles will be able to drive themselves and all that is needed is for a person to input their destination and sit back. I think that the interior of the vehicles will be the biggest changes because these vehicles will allow people to sit back and relax. I think that the interior will be comfortable seats and have TVs to pass the time. Overall I imagine future transportation being someone similar to today but with less demand on people.
2591,5,241,['transportation'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
2592,5,241,['transportation'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
2593,5,241,['transportation'],personal transportation is one of the best innovation.
2594,5,241,['transportation'],"Telepads! The Transportation of the Future! Simply step on this portal pad, and you are instantly transported to your location! The movement of molecules into energy is completely safe, and many users only experience a minor burning sensation for a minute after the teleportation process. Forget flying cars, late trains or other outdated modes of transport, and tele away with Telepads!"
2595,6,214,['bus'],"A big massive trailer with comfortable seats, and a breakfast bar that you can sign up for so it comes to your house, or a predetermined bus stop at a certain time.  Everything is reserved so you must opt in.  On the bus there is simple things, such as bagels/croissants/danish etc.  It's a good way to grab a quick bite to eat before work, and wake yourself up with some coffee.  The bus will use an algorithm to determine people to put on the bus that are on the way to the same destination, or a similar destination, while not going too far out of the way to pick them up."
2596,6,214,['bus'],A bunch of self driving cars that will replace buses and taxis. The will have free wifi and be very cheap.
2597,6,214,['bus'],"A bus system similar to a paternoster, but horizontal instead of vertical. This would be a system of interconnected cars with seats that would follow along a set track in a loop, and always be running, so people would just walk on and walk off the system when they reached their stop - no stopping and starting."
2598,6,214,['bus'],a bus system that lets you rack up points for rewards
2599,6,214,['bus'],"A Bus system, within the metro area that was funded by a tax on gas purchased by individual commuters. In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."
2600,6,214,['bus'],"A bus that has a design similar to a hydrofoil boat. The bus would run on special tracks that would be parallel to each other on opposite sides of a street. This passenger compartment would be on top, with the ""foils"" connecting to the two tracks. There would be open space underneath the passenger compartment where the road is. This way, the bus could move unimpeded by traffic, while also not disrupting traffic itself. Also, passengers would not even see the traffic below them, making the ride smooth, comfortable, and consistent."
2601,6,214,['bus'],"a bus that has little cars in it to take people different places, and once it lets them out the car returns to the bus for others"
2602,6,214,['bus'],"A bus that is programed to do the fastest route possible for what people need. There is a station where they push their destination, and a program figurs out who needs to go where and the best way to do it. Reduces wait time and makes more people want to use it."
2603,6,214,['bus'],A bus with 8 off road tires and a strong engine that could easily get the passengers through even the snowiest of days. We can call it the Wolverine.
2604,6,214,['bus'],A bus with live performers
2605,6,214,['bus'],A cab system which optimizes fares by calculating the best way to get multiple people to their destination. It's like a bus but it doesn't follow a route.
2606,6,214,['bus'],"A circulatory bus system consisting of two vehicle traveling in opposite directions on a set route but with no designated stops. The route in my small district of the city takes approximately 20 minutes to to circumnavigate and consists of goth commercial districts. One would never be more than 10 minutes fro being able to hail the ""jitney"" bus. This alleviates the use of regular bus system which is much more focused on funneling clientele to central city and runs more or less eradicately.It envisions using current tech and is human centered. It is innovative in it's goals not hardware."
2607,6,214,['bus'],A city bus that has entertainment in it like movies and music
2608,6,214,['bus'],"A concept similar to Uber, but with a bus. Especially in a city the socialization factor of riding with other passengers while going to a destination could be nice. You would be able to specifically request stops and pickups."
2609,6,214,['bus'],A crowd-sourced bus stop app. Instead of having fixed bus stops throughout the city. People through a smart phone app request a bus to stop at a certain locations. This would provide information to the bus service company in improving the locations and times of where service is needed the most.
2610,6,214,['bus'],A drone system where small helicopters would come down and pick up people. It would work like a bus in that it takes people to drone stops.
2611,6,214,['bus'],"A fleet of smart, autonomous busses."
2612,6,214,['bus'],"A free taxi service for students, especially for nights so that students can get back safely. Instead of a car or a big bus, it could be a small bus so that it can fit enough people, but not use too much gas."
2613,6,214,['bus'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
2614,6,214,['bus'],A map that has the location of buses currently running so that you can see how long it takes for your bus to reach you while waiting for the bus.
2615,6,214,['bus'],"A more affordable public transit (or shuttle bus) that is crowdsourced/crowdfunded and takes passengers anywhere within a certain radius (e.g. 30 mile radius, etc.)."
2616,6,214,['bus'],"A more thorough bus system with buses running more frequently and covering a wider area.  Other modes would not be feasible for this area.



An Uber-type crowd-sourced system for carpooling."
2617,6,214,['bus'],A new bus route that could go through my town. It would have a different route than the buses we currently have.
2618,6,214,['bus'],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
2619,6,214,['bus'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be similar to a train line, just on a smaller scale. It would pick people up in a series of pods and deposit them at their place of work for a small fee. This new train type line could also be used in the same way that a bus is, to run errands. The new system would have comfortable couch like chairs and be far more acceptable than the current forms of trnasportation availabe."
2620,6,214,['bus'],"A new transportation system would be a large electric powered bus. It would not run on gasoline but on electricity. It would pick people up from stops and drop them off for a fee. It would also go into smaller developments to pick people up like an Uber would, but more environmentally friendly."
2621,6,214,['bus'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
2622,6,214,['bus'],"A new type of transportation in my area would be like a double decker bus, but more levels. There would be different areas for kids, a lounge area, an elevator that would take you do the different levels. You would pay a monthly fee and it would have a path where it would make stops. Not just a mode of transporation, but a fun transportation where you can relax and interact with people at the same time."
2623,6,214,['bus'],A new way to transport in my neighborhood? I would honestly say cabs. They are not around where I live. But a cheaper way and only in the city. It's mostly just busses and the stops are few and far between.
2624,6,214,['bus'],A online map real time of the buses and trains the area. Buses and trains aren't usually on time and having real on time traffic will show if its a bad bad to drive.
2625,6,214,['bus'],"A person's place of employment, such as a hospital could conceivably shuttle employees from home to work via a small bus. The city or county could be divided into quadrants to further facilitate timely pickups. This would definitely free up traffic if the workplace had 9000+ employees."
2626,6,214,['bus'],"A pod/train system that runs on the shoulder of roads. It would be more active than typical buses, and be more personal in that there can be no more than 4 passengers. It would run on a track or in the future it would would run with automatic sensing software and would drive itself."
2627,6,214,['bus'],A public bus system of buses the size of vans. It has an app that shows all the stops.
2628,6,214,['bus'],"A real trolley/tram system, not a bus that they call a trolley. Rails. Automated, pre-programmed directions. Various sensors to determine speed/safety restrictions."
2629,6,214,['bus'],"A roaming private car that you can pay by the mile or carpool. Basically, the car would go up and down the street or area and put trips together (like going to the grocery store or the same shopping center) and split the costs, so it can be as affordable as a bus but more private."
2630,6,214,['bus'],A skateboard tram that runs on a track through the neighborhood to the local bus stops
2631,6,214,['bus'],"A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
2632,6,214,['bus'],"A sort of rail line, but it's a single rail and has many hanging carts. The carts hold maybe 4 people at a time, like a taxi. The price would be cheaper than a bus and they would arrive quickly when you need them. You could push a button on poles that are located around the city, far more often than bus stops, and the cart will come to you quickly and take you directly to your destination. No need for bus drivers or waiting for traffic!"
2633,6,214,['bus'],A tram in each Mohalla (Locality) that goes to a central place called Zero point and from there a common bus takes all the passengers that arrives in trams to the market.
2634,6,214,['bus'],"A trolley system would be a great source of transportation, using small trolleys instead of buses.  Another Idea would be a mini bus system that primarily transported people to key areas like the train station or the airport.  A shuttle system."
2635,6,214,['bus'],A way to reduce congestion would be to have more water busses.  It can work like uber or just a regular bus.  There could be many ports or just a few to cut long ride times.
2636,6,214,['bus'],"A zip line from the place where I take the bus to the subway would be great. It would cut out all the traffic and possibly be much faster than taking the bus to the subway. Also, there would be multiple pods that would lock in the destination and go non-stop so it wouldn't be stopping every few minutes to pick up passengers."
2637,6,214,['bus'],Adding a metro to our area would be great. It would provide a quicker way to get around as opposed to the buses that are frequently full. It could run from the residential areas to the university.
2638,6,214,['bus'],"Alternative energy powered vehicles. Using electricity, sunlight, and other renewable sources can be beneficial to society. Imagine if every car, motorcycle, bus, stopped using gas."
2639,6,214,['bus'],An AI that tells certain buses or train to slow down at a certain rate to decrease accidents making traffic more efficient.
2640,6,214,['bus'],"An all electric bus. They would be plugged in over night and run during the day and vice versa. It would run on a normal schedule, but not run on fuel."
2641,6,214,['bus'],"An alternate transportation system in my neighborhood would be a free transportation system that can take you anywhere that you like. Paying for transportation is not easy since everybody carries debit or credit cards nowadays. Hardly anybody has change or cash on them. Free transportation would be great, and it should be something other than a bus. It should just be a regular vehicle as well with a friendly driver to take you somewhere."
2642,6,214,['bus'],"An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
2643,6,214,['bus'],"An uber-like system for public transit busses. Riders must request pick up 24 hours ahead of time, and the bus would come to their door or as close as it could to pick the rider up. The fare could be determined by how many riders requested pick up, and drop off to a central location (downtown). From there maybe there would be additional busses that go directly to drop off points rather than on a pre-set route."
2644,6,214,['bus'],"An underground tunnel system just for people, bikes and mopeds.  The idea is that all the cars and congestion can stay up above and people can safely walk or transport themselves around without worrying about cars and busses getting in the way or being run over by them.  Every so often there is a ramp that allows you to exit, as well as natural light through grates and proper ventilation.  It would also be a great way to get around when it snows."
2645,6,214,['bus'],"App integrated public & private transport, using location services in smartphones to sync to trains, buses, taxis, Ubers Zipcars etc to streamline travel. Using a global integrated app to pay for any type of transport service"
2646,6,214,['bus'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
2647,6,214,['bus'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
2648,6,214,['bus'],"Automated bus lines that run to every street in America. Something similar to a trolley system, without the rails."
2649,6,214,['bus'],"Bus lines that run on algorythms generated by apps on citizens' phones in order to insure adequate service and reduce waste.  In off hours, users can ""ping"" the authority before they reach the stop they expect to be picked up at."
2650,6,214,['bus'],"Bus passes can be used for bike passes also.  Take the bus as far as it goes, then  switch to a bike or scooter for rent."
2651,6,214,['bus'],Buses are the best.  The best thing would be way more bus stops so we don't have to walk as far.  it would be even better to have longer hours that they are running.  maybe an app could tell the driver to stop at specific locations where someone is ready to be picked up instead of at traditional bus stops.  that would be great.
2652,6,214,['bus'],"buses should be branded by route, and have brightly colored easy to identify signs"
2653,6,214,['bus'],Buses that go everywhere.
2654,6,214,['bus'],"Buses that have the ability to carry bikes for their customers.

Many people don't live next to a bus station and ride their bikes there so if the bus had a place for the bikes it would really help the customers out."
2655,6,214,['bus'],"CAR IS GOOD FOR FAMILY DRIVE.

SCOOTER IS BEST FOR SINGLE ONE

BUS IS SUITABLE FOR LONG TRAVELLING

TRAIN IS BEST FOR LONG TRAVELLING WITH FAMILY

BICYCLES ARE MAINLY USED FOR EXERCISE AND SCHOOL CHILDREN"
2656,6,214,['bus'],"City buses that actually go downtown and to the places that people need to go, instead of just around the edges of town. Also, have a fleet of bikes that people could rent for $1/hr to ride the distances downtown like some other cities."
2657,6,214,['bus'],"Community electric trollies. We don't have any type of public transport except buses, and it would be especially nice to have something environmentally friendly!"
2658,6,214,['bus'],"Companies should use some of their advertising budget to provide rides to certain places.  This would double as advertising for that company, so they would not lose out on money and we could get unique transportation for several untapped routes, especially if it is discovered that a lot of people are traveling outside of their usual living area, like for a special event.  The companies could create specialized buses so that several people can ride, and can put their logo on the outside of the bus and could name the transportation something catchy using the company name so that word-of-mouth provides extra advertising."
2659,6,214,['bus'],"Create a very strong drone that has bench seats for people. It'll be like a flying bus, able to get people to their destinations faster than a traditional road bus."
2660,6,214,['bus'],"Currently, I live in a small town that has a public transportation system. However, you have to call and wait for the bus to pick you up, instead of waiting at a pre-determined stop, and it can take forever to get where you're going. I propose a busing system that's like the one in bigger cities for my neighborhood. People could still call and wait for a bus, but buses should also stop and pick people up at predetermined stops at regular intervals."
2661,6,214,['bus'],"Currently, my city is very underserved by the public transportation system. I believe that the existing public transit should be expanded with a greater fleet of buses, so that all people in my community could be served. The buses currently in operation only reach about half (if that) of the city's occupants, leaving many without an opportunity to get where they need to go quickly and affordably."
2662,6,214,['bus'],Drone hovercraft school bus
2663,6,214,['bus'],Electric (gas-free) busses.
2664,6,214,['bus'],Electric buses would be an amazing addition to my city but we would have to integrate a system of cables that the city may or may not support. San Francisco has the ones I mean.
2665,6,214,['bus'],"Electromagnetic transportation would be an innovative way to travel. I am thinking more so on the side of  ""being green"". Imagine a bus or railway style vessel that moves along a track with the force of magnets. It would eliminate the need for gas or diesel."
2666,6,214,['bus'],Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
2667,6,214,['bus'],"First off, that's a really choppy question.



There could be a network of ride sharing. Sort of like if Uber was a bus. People would have a regular route and others would request a ride to a central location. It would be mostly people commuting to work together. This would be done through phone apps."
2668,6,214,['bus'],"For transportation in my neighborhood we have cars, and buses. The most popular mode of transportation being the four door family sedan type car. Following that it's the minivan and then the four-door trucks. They can be seen whizzing back and forth on the roads causing many traffic jams during peak morning hours."
2669,6,214,['bus'],"From small towns to big cities, public transportation is helping to generate new vitality like never

before. Beautiful, walkable town squares combine residential, retail, office, recreation and public

transportation features to make community living easy. New bus services and light rail extensions

improve mobility and ease congestion. Even the smallest adjustments, like widening sidewalks and

adding bikeways, can provide dramatic impact and value."
2670,6,214,['bus'],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
2671,6,214,['bus'],"Get some large vans and people who are going to the same general area to work can all ride together.  They take turns driving.  It'll be like kids' school buses but for adults.  It'll save money and help bond co-workers together.  There will be enough room for a lot of people so the chances of an incident are slim.  It'll also help when it's bad weather because some people are afraid to drive in it and this would ease some of that stress.  Plus, they could all share in the maintenance and gas for the bus/car so that could save them a lot of money."
2672,6,214,['bus'],Give people segways or hoverboards and then have a transport for those smaller transportations methods. Sort of like a car-carrier or bus that you board with your segway or hoverboard.
2673,6,214,['bus'],"Have old school buses converted into Eco friendly vehicles, then have them purchases by large local companies and drive to neighborhoods to pick up workers."
2674,6,214,['bus'],have school buses equiped with gps so you can track and not have the kids wait out in the cold.
2675,6,214,['bus'],Having a neighborhood run community bus system. It would be exclusively a bus for people in the neighborhood to travel short distances.
2676,6,214,['bus'],having an on call drunk bus service
2677,6,214,['bus'],"Having charter buses pick you up from designated spots around the city and dropping you off in various locations around, such as the mall, groceries etc."
2678,6,214,['bus'],Horse drawn carriage would rock here in this southwestern mountain town. People would really love it and it would be more reasonable for my area than just your average bus or taxi.
2679,6,214,['bus'],"How about a deluxe line of buses. You have to pay 150 or above a month for a pass, but these run better routes, and they actually run on time. The regular monthly bus pass is 65, but the service is terrible. On this new route, absolutely no discounts, no half fares, no free rides. Always have security on the bus to get rid of the riff raff. This new deluxe bus wouldn't even share stops with the regular bus route."
2680,6,214,['bus'],"hyper-bullet trains

solar-powered buses"
2681,6,214,['bus'],"I am deaf. That is why I would like to see closed captioning to announcements made to deaf, or a special light shown when there was a mechanical breakdown, and we could not hear the announcement to transfer to another bus."
2682,6,214,['bus'],I am thinking of something like a city bus system but for uber. Rather than having to go from stop to stop and hope people are there the bus system can be smarter and go to the most packed stops or to those who have been waiting the longest based upon when they clicked the app. It would be much more efficient.
2683,6,214,['bus'],"I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
2684,6,214,['bus'],I doubt I would take a bus but having them as an option would help some people
2685,6,214,['bus'],"I envision a new transportation system where we use old school busses to transport people to work.  The busses should be turned into green vehicles electric, hybrid or the like."
2686,6,214,['bus'],I have an idea of using only one big bus for our entire residence association
2687,6,214,['bus'],"I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
2688,6,214,['bus'],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
2689,6,214,['bus'],I imagine a way to ride a school bus to various spots on its route. You would be pre-screened as an adult who could act as a school bus monitor and at the same time gain transportation to a location near the school. It would solve the problem of kids riding unsupervised and give another public transportation option in the neighborhood.
2690,6,214,['bus'],"I live in a rural area so horseback travel, hay wagon travel and buckboard travel may well be decent substitutes for cars and buses presently being used."
2691,6,214,['bus'],"I live in a very rural area that doesn't get bus service because of low population. My idea would be a bus service that runs on the same premise as a taxi service... when someone in the area would need a ride, the bus would alter its route to pick up a passenger. That way, the remote area could be serviced by mass transit, yet wouldn't have to waste fuel or money driving to the remote area all of the time. These requests could be put in via phone, web portal, or e-mail."
2692,6,214,['bus'],"i live in twin falls idaho and we could use a bus line, i guess it isn't a new idea  but yeah this is a place where there is sharp economic divide and all the businesses are on the rich side of town, the original town or the poor side of town ""old town"" is roughly a mile from the main drag so buses would be great for people who cant afford cars and better for the environment in general"
2693,6,214,['bus'],"I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
2694,6,214,['bus'],I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
2695,6,214,['bus'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
2696,6,214,['bus'],"I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
2697,6,214,['bus'],"I think a private school bus would be a great idea. Maybe it could be the size of a SUV and fit maybe 4 to 6 kids in it comfortable. Some kids are not able to take a bus to school so parents have to take public transportation every morning to drop them off. It could be like a Uber school bus sort of, each SUV bus will have certain school on their route that they can drop kids off at."
2698,6,214,['bus'],I think a spiral starting from the center of the city going out to the edges of the city.  The spiral should be able to get all the areas if it's only 2-3 blocks wide.  It would have a dedicated lane so traffic wouldn't affect the bus and vice versa.  There would be a way to quickly have people enter and exit the bus and this would keep it on time.  Of course the bus is electric powered.
2699,6,214,['bus'],I think adding a rail system in my city would be a great idea. The only public transportation we have is buses and there are a lot of areas they don't even run to. So I think a rail system would do wonders in getting a lot of other people where they were going.
2700,6,214,['bus'],"I think an automatic bus, possibly on a rail system so the times would be more predictable and rigorous."
2701,6,214,['bus'],I think because my city isn't THAT big a place that takes us to all the the important parts is vital. You would think a bus would do that but not the ones in my city. It's just small stops.
2702,6,214,['bus'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
2703,6,214,['bus'],"I think that a trolly system would work well in phoenix.  They would run frequently, be smaller than a bus and go into more neighborhoods."
2704,6,214,['bus'],I think that public buses should have some type of bike rack on the back of the bus. Some people want to take their bikes with them somewhere but the place is to far to bike the whole way.  The can chain their bike to the bike rack and remove it when they get off the bus. Of course space would be limited to about 2-3 bikes.
2705,6,214,['bus'],I think that there could be a light rail system or electric buses. there is enough sunlight to make them 100% clean
2706,6,214,['bus'],"I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
2707,6,214,['bus'],I would imagine an electric scooter or hoverboard rental system.  You could use them when going to and from a train station stop and to your final destination.  I imagine a rental system so that you could pick one up at a train or bus station to go your extra distance and return it when you return.  Renting would be a good option if you did not have your own with you or only use it with other public transportation. Bad weather is always an issue using these devices.
2708,6,214,['bus'],"I would l to see a system of transportation where the service would do home pickups,similar to a bus, only the stops would be made at your home regularly for a monthly or yearly fee."
2709,6,214,['bus'],"I would like a golf cart system that could get the kids to school on the paths, kind of like a bus system but on a much smaller scale."
2710,6,214,['bus'],I would like there to be a fast speed rail such as in Japan or Germany. I picture it being accurate time-wise and capable of transporting people over great distances. I would prefer it to a bus situation.
2711,6,214,['bus'],"I would like to see a commuter bus with complete wifi access, as well as office equipment available."
2712,6,214,['bus'],I would like to see a system that would be quicker for pickups and drop offs. This would mean vehicles similar to busses but smaller and more efficient.
2713,6,214,['bus'],"I would like to see public transportation on buses expanded in my area, with a dedicated area for bicycles to also be transported on the buses.  This would help a lot with traffic, and still allow people to get to their destinations quickly."
2714,6,214,['bus'],I would say the biggest way to improve innovating is to have all new construction be made in regards to current public transporation hub and those that cnanot be require them to build a public transportation hub. So all new communities have bus access or train access.
2715,6,214,['bus'],I'd like to see the combination of a food truck and a taxi. This way you could grab a fresh made bite to eat while on your way to the destination. There would be a seating area in the front and a small kitchen with a service window in the back. This bus could serve hot and cold sandwiches and maybe drinkable soup in cups with lids to prevent spills. Now all you have to do is hail a cab. Forget finding something to eat then looking for the cab. The food can be prepared for you onboard.
2716,6,214,['bus'],"I'd love to see a crowdsourced method of alternate transportation in my city, where people could request rides from others who happen to be in the area and going the direction you need to with a minimal cost. There are so many people who have cars and it would be a great option for people who don't have reliable access to one. It could use cell phone apps and perhaps even have a traditional component using telephone for people who are less technologically inclined. The biggest challenge would be safety/security, and I'm honestly not sure how to overcome that aspect. There could be specific stops, almost like bus stops, where people could gather and wait for rides, or schedule rides to pick them up at certain times."
2717,6,214,['bus'],"I'd really like to see a little pod that you could get into.  It has a minor sedative so you can relax on your commute.  A bus or something of the sort would come by and pick up pods which are locked and only you can open.  You hang a sign or type in your wanted destination, and a bus that goes roughly to the area scoops you up.  



Upon getting to your destination, the bus drops you off at a stop, and the sedative wears off with an alarm to wake you up."
2718,6,214,['bus'],"I'd use apps and social media so I know the times of all transport.  If it's late, I don't want to hang out too long. An app would pick up my location and show the times of the buses or street car. I could set it to warn me too."
2719,6,214,['bus'],"In many neighborhoods, stop signs are ignored. I believe switching to yield signs, where ideally suitable, is needed and adding 'bus stops' for local schools that do not hinder traffic."
2720,6,214,['bus'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
2721,6,214,['bus'],"In my neighborhood, any kind of public transportation would be innovative. Due to the apparent stigma of such, I would propose a lovely electric-run ""uber coach"" instead of the big ugly city bus. This could be as simple as a mini-van and could deliver us suffering commuters of Southern California from a few select and regular pick-up spots to bigger, car-pool mega spots at various freeway points."
2722,6,214,['bus'],In the city i live in there is no public transportation. If some rails or buses could be brought in it could help a lot of people here.
2723,6,214,['bus'],"in the future i would like for there to be a bus that is run on peddles that way people are able to work out while getting to where they need to go and they can take breaks if they are too tired. however, they cant stop for too long. also this will decrease the amount of gas that is being used"
2724,6,214,['bus'],Instead of buses or trains that come at specific times there would be a looped track with chairs that circles the city constantly there would never be a wait as it would be running constantly.
2725,6,214,['bus'],"Interactive bus schedule app. You pick the starting destination and ending point, plus leave time and it will tell you what time the bus comes to that point, what the ETA and travel schedule is. Also would give a total cost for the trip. I live in a neighboring county and the small bus hooks up with the city bus, but I have no idea what time the bus comes to the bus stop by my house, nor how I would transfer to the bus that takes me to work."
2726,6,214,['bus'],"It is not innovative in terms of the whole world, but would be very innovative in my community - bike shares. The area where I live is suburban, so difficult to get enough riders for frequent mass transit. And it's too spread out for just walking. Bike share stands, where subscribers had a code to access bikes from a bike locker, would allow people to commute from place to place (even just to nearby main bus routes) with relative ease."
2727,6,214,['bus'],It would be a free system (every family in the neighborhood would have to contribute $300-$400 as a one time fee). Then the bus would run through the neighborhood every hour and take you to anywhere in the neighborhood that you need to go! You would be able to text the driver before hand of where you are going.
2728,6,214,['bus'],It would be a new school bus system that runs on renewable energy. No more gas would be needed to get the kids to school and back home. Making our city one more step greener and setting the bar high!
2729,6,214,['bus'],It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
2730,6,214,['bus'],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
2731,6,214,['bus'],"It would be better if the government will create a new transpo scheme wherein there will be a separate lane for buses, a separate late wherein it is closed for every other vehicle and there are stations for the customers just like in train/subway system, card system will be used in the stations estimated time of the next bus arrival shown on screen and it can also be checked through a mobile app"
2732,6,214,['bus'],"It would be great if we could improve the pubic transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road. I would like to see self driving buses as well as bus only lanes and self driving cars. No manually controlled cars would be allowed and because of this hopefully the roads will be safer because most accidents and caused by human error. We could have the speed limits increased as well because self driving cars can ""see"" a lot father ahead than humans."
2733,6,214,['bus'],"It would replace everything: roads, sideways, buses, etc. It would be electric powered. Definitely automated. You should be able to transport to wherever you want to go without lifting a finger. Since it would replace sidewalks, you can simple stand on it and it would move you from one place to another, like a conveyor belt. It would be financed by monthly subscription, with VIP access for a higher price you can travel on the road with automatic cars that would operate in similar fashion."
2734,6,214,['bus'],Just a more streamlined bus and rail service. I'd make buses easier to track.
2735,6,214,['bus'],"Larger Vehicles for apps like Uber that set up car pool for large amounts of people that are going to the same area. For example in Austin, Texas many people enjoy 6th straight but struggle to find parking. If apps like uber could set up their own busses or larger vehicles for transportation to places like 6th street or concerts/ sports arenas it would be much more efficient than a bus that makes regular stops."
2736,6,214,['bus'],"Light rail. Basically, street card running between the most popular stops. They don't have to run everywhere, but on their routes they'd be more efficient than buses. You count put the rails on the side of the streets, near the sidewalks."
2737,6,214,['bus'],"Luxury busses, nicer busses for people who don't want to own a car but want nicer transportation than what you get from a public bus experience"
2738,6,214,['bus'],make more busses available with more bicycle carrying capacity
2739,6,214,['bus'],"Mass transit only routes that expedite buses, bikes and High occupancy vehicles on smaller , yet more direct routes. Toll type control and monitoring. Make a single person in s single car very difficult and punitive"
2740,6,214,['bus'],"Might as well offer mass transit that also includes dining services in the bus, in addition to completely free wifi.  Could also offer services to wash cars at the pick up site, so that when you get to your car in the evening it's already clean"
2741,6,214,['bus'],Mini bus services around the neighborhood covering the residential area so that single rides can be reduced
2742,6,214,['bus'],more train/subway connections and better bus service. Better communication as to when buses arrive etc
2743,6,214,['bus'],"Moving platforms that function like traincars and moving sidewalks put together. They would go above roads, have railings on each side and be like busses with bus stops. You could buy a thing like a bus pass that allows you x number of rides, so that you don't have to have cash on your person to be able to get on it. It would run from neighborhoods to main city areas and only be running when people call for it/use it to save money on electricity/gas/whatever"
2744,6,214,['bus'],"My city is a little small and close together. Most people use a car or the bus. I think it would be a great idea if more people rode bicycles, and I don't think it would take much longer to get where they need to go."
2745,6,214,['bus'],My city is currently looking at High Occupancy Travel toll lanes.  I've thought that a dedicated lane for buses or van pools would be an alternative that could let the car commuters see the speed at which these other options can get to work.  This would encourage the use of the bus / van pool options.
2746,6,214,['bus'],"My city is right on the ocean and there are many canals within the city as well, so I think a kind of transportation system with water taxis or some kind of water buses would be really useful. In a lot of cases I think this kind of transportation would be faster and more accessible to people, especially if it was willing to pick people up at designated locations or even right off their own docks for those who have them."
2747,6,214,['bus'],My idea is having double decker buses to accommodate more people in public transportation.
2748,6,214,['bus'],"My mode of alternative transportation would include cars, buses, and trams running on solar energy in roadways. I'm unsure how it would work exactly, but if we could harness the power of the sun and build vehicles that have the panels either on them or in the tires it could remove the use of fossil fuels."
2749,6,214,['bus'],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
2750,6,214,['bus'],My neighborhood has no transportation system. So a simple bus would help.
2751,6,214,['bus'],"My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
2752,6,214,['bus'],"My town is in desparate need of a form of public transportation. Everyone is reliant on a car or scooter. I think they don't have enough need to  warrant a bus route, but I'm in favor of widening the tiny bicycle lanes they have."
2753,6,214,['bus'],"Need busses, or sccoters"
2754,6,214,['bus'],"One day per month (at least) cars should be banned from the roads. Some buses could be allowed to allow for transportation of people who can't walk or bike, but this would be a great way to encourage human-powered transport and allow people to see the fun in this activity without increased danger from car traffic.  This would also be great for the environment."
2755,6,214,['bus'],our city is metro .population is a big problem there and traffic too .large no of people use public transport like trains and buses but also use scooter in large nos as its easy to go to places when there is lot of traffic on rads to avoid jams.
2756,6,214,['bus'],"Public skype/facetime stations in major transportation hubs (bus or train stations, airports)."
2757,6,214,['bus'],Renewable energy vehicle such as an electrical bus or trolley. An Uber like service that uses low emissions vehicles or electrical ones.
2758,6,214,['bus'],Rental electrical bike stations near the bus stops.  You can check out a bike like you were at a library.
2759,6,214,['bus'],"Ride scooters to a local bus stop that. Houses scooters on the bus, up to 10 miles from house, to work in the inner city, (25 miles from bus stop) it would save gas and pollution, instead of 25 people driving take a bus. Scooters get better Mpg and it's safer to stay on a bus on a highway than a scooter."
2760,6,214,['bus'],"School Bus taxi. School buses rumble down our street every day, often not every seat is taken. If you knew the route, and had been vetted through security, you could pay a small fare to hop on and ride along the route, even connecting to other school buses. It would be an energy-efficient mode of transportation. Also, more adults on the bus would probably reduce bullying among the kids."
2761,6,214,['bus'],segways at same rental price as bus fare.  I have a broken toe and bad knee and it is hard sometimes to walk all the way to bus stops if they are far.
2762,6,214,['bus'],Service that allows you to call for a bus and the closest one will arrive at your location
2763,6,214,['bus'],"Since rail is very expensive, I'd like to see more express bus routes, hopefully with their own lanes to keep them flowing faster than traffic and give an incentive to use them.  Make the buses as comfortable as possible, again as an incentive for use."
2764,6,214,['bus'],solar powered mini bus system - florida
2765,6,214,['bus'],Something akin to a streetcar or trolley bus system could be very useful in my city.  It would have its own designated lane and be a useful public transportation alternative.
2766,6,214,['bus'],"Something like a bus stop, however you would be picked up and dropped off by someone who might be passing through, other drivers, company vehicles (like UPS trucks), etc."
2767,6,214,['bus'],"Something like the company UBER that uses school buses, or lynx buses to pick up large groups of people quickly. If a family of 25 all want to go somewhere and no one has a car...have no fear BuUBER is here!"
2768,6,214,['bus'],"Something like Uber or Lyft, but for getting kids to school. This way it's on an as needed basis rather than paying a flat fee for bus service that may not always be used for one reason or another. Especially when the child is staying late for practice or what not."
2769,6,214,['bus'],"Subways with shorter runs. NYC is filled with unused tunnels and stations. Get them up and running. Also, allow people who use any sort of wheel-based transport, that's not a bus or car, to use the bike lanes."
2770,6,214,['bus'],"Take the train  to its nearest destination  to your destination.  Get off the train, and rent a bike or scooter to take you to your exact location.  Drop off the bike there, and it's waiting for you for your return trip to the train.  Monthly passes cover all types of transportation and cards are used for bus, train, bike and scooter use."
2771,6,214,['bus'],"The cat bus is a new public transportation system where riders get to interact with 2 or more cats! The cats will be in cages, but they will be larger cages so they have room to roam. There will also be an enclosed cage where the cats who are too excited from the social stimulation can be alone."
2772,6,214,['bus'],"The city could do a partial co pay or cheap taxi or destination bus service. as in you meet the bus at a specific pick up place but then you tell the address you want, no designated stop."
2773,6,214,['bus'],The employer would work on a system to have every employee's address and map it.  Then a very large carpool could be created to make it easy for everyone to get there on time and save them money.  The employer could also provide the bus or van to make it even better.
2774,6,214,['bus'],The idea is that free long term parking is offered at multiple nodes throughout the outskirts of the city. Within the city there are three primary modes of transport: public bicycles (if needed) for short distances between bus stops for medium distances and at key points throughout the city train stations for the longest stretches for cross city travel.
2775,6,214,['bus'],"The suburbs are not currently served by the bus system. I believe that each suburb should get its own bus, which will take riders to a bus stop in the city. There, they may catch another bus or walk to their destination."
2776,6,214,['bus'],The van cars can be used as a means of transport for dropping people at scheduled times just like buses. They will have limited stops to minimize wait time and people using cars for nearby locations can use it instead of using cars personally or waiting for bus at bus stops which go stopping at all the bus stops.
2777,6,214,['bus'],"There are solar powered buses in my neighborhood which are 100% sustainable and operate autonomously, very much like the commuter trams at some airports such as Miami International Airport. These require no labor, and as such, have no human element involved in decisionmaking. As they are programmed to stop at intervals (designated by where the bus stops would be) there is a set time to off-load and pick up customers. OF course, handicapped and large groups can press a certain button which would allow more time and/or ramps to deploy."
2778,6,214,['bus'],"There could be a train type of system but not using metal tracks like they have in europe (above ground?)  The trolley or bus could be made to target things people wanna go do instead of just transportation.  Like grocery shopping or night out to watch movie theatre and that way everyone is grouped and the businesses upsales, etc can develop better because of that."
2779,6,214,['bus'],There is no bus system so my idea is for a bus system in my area.  I live in a suburbs of a small town and there is no bus out here.  It would be nice to have one.  Sometimes I don't have access to a car and maybe this bus could help me get to the store or church.  I would also like the bus system to be able to take me to the small town to go shopping and stuff.
2780,6,214,['bus'],There needs to be a new system that picks you up at your place. A bus system that you can call to pick you up and the closest one will come. Kind of like a taxi but a bus so it can carry a lot more people.
2781,6,214,['bus'],"There should be a free bus that runs from several locations (school, downtown, etc) to the train station on a loop all day and weekend. People would be able to hop on and off with ease."
2782,6,214,['bus'],There should be a system where you can call for the bus to pick you up instead of it stopping at certain stops. It would go to the certain stops also but also pick you up if it has extra space in the time it has so it can save the Earth with carpooling.
2783,6,214,['bus'],"There should be paid service for a bus route to pick up people who live right outside a city. I will use my self as an example for my idea. I live about 20 miles for a major city . If I didn't have a automobile I would not be able to get anywhere important. Now the nearest cilty has a bus route only for those in the city. But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area. The school bus service already does this , I don't know why the city could come up with a plan to offer public transportation for adults living in rural areas. It's just very stupid that this is not a thing in Houston ."
2784,6,214,['bus'],there will be driver-less cars and a lite rail system. There will still be some (free) bus transportation to fill in the gaps and help negate the need for new roads
2785,6,214,['bus'],"There would be a street train that would take people from downtown down the main road to the city limits. It would also connect to service to the next big city over. Bus service would be more frequent, and Uber would be allowed to begin service."
2786,6,214,['bus'],This idea is about cable bus. Bus moving through cable in air. The cables are places all across the city in air. The bus moves across the cable without any traffic block. There will be stops.
2787,6,214,['bus'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
2788,6,214,['bus'],"Ticket sharing system for people who make infrequent trips into the city, or suddenly need to do several trips in a row. A group of people could collectively share a commuter pass for the train or bus system. It would be like a Netflix of commuter passes. The ticket could be held in an existing business or maybe a library, and the ticket would be checked out like a book. People would pay each day they hold the ticket."
2789,6,214,['bus'],"To help cover a lot of area of a city, the could be a central hub where all the trains, busses, etc start.  Then from that one spot, all the route lines shoot out, like a star.  That way all the people can be at one spot and make it to where they want to go easily since there are no transfers or any other confusing things."
2790,6,214,['bus'],Uber bus.

2792,6,214,['bus'],"Unfortunately, I live in a very small/rural town, so future transportation system would likely be simple public bus transit."
2793,6,214,['bus'],UTILIZE SCHOOL BUSES DURING DOWN TIME TO GIVE CHEAP RIDES
2794,6,214,['bus'],"Vehicles that circle around a block, which allow for passengers to jump right on.  Not necessarily a bus."
2795,6,214,['bus'],We already have bus system.  I think people that live close together and work at same place the boss should give incentive to carpool together.
2796,6,214,['bus'],"We could have busses that worked like uber.  Instead of having specific spots, people could put in their location and where they want to end.  Then the busses would know when and who to pick up along constantly changing and evolving routes."
2797,6,214,['bus'],we could incorporate a public bus system.
2798,6,214,['bus'],We could use a street with magnets that support other cars that could be used as busses for a fraction of the cost in gas.
2799,6,214,['bus'],We have lots of busses that are never full. Phase them out in favor of smaller vehicles that are electric or hybrid.
2800,6,214,['bus'],We ought to revisit the trolley system because the buses in New York City are plagued by heavy traffic. We should have electric trolleys on main thoroughfares. It worked in the old days. Sometimes old ideas mixed with new technology is GENIUS!
2801,6,214,['bus'],We should have an underground subway system. For a city as large as the one I live in it would make sense. It would be faster for everyone and clear the roads of buses that clog up traffic during rush hour.
2802,6,214,['bus'],"When I traveled Asia they had trucks with benches in the back, they went around the same routes all and quickly picked up and dropped off people, similar to a bus but quicker and easier"
2803,6,214,['bus'],a bus that plays all 80s music all the time
2804,6,214,['bus'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
2805,6,214,['bus'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
2806,6,214,['bus'],"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."
2807,6,214,['bus'],"Sleeper buses that pick you up after a night of drinking, and take you to your workplace in the morning, which include showers."
2808,6,214,['bus'],"Something like Uber or Lyft, but for getting kids to school. This way it's on an as needed basis rather than paying a flat fee for bus service that may not always be used for one reason or another. Especially when the child is staying late for practice or what not."
2809,7,164,['neighborhood'],"-a gondola system like at a ski resort

-it will be high speed and high capacity, holding up to 10 people per cart

-there will be ""Stations"" going from each major neighborhood center going towards major popular destinations like malls, restaurants, etc."
2810,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A both walking and bike lane that provides safety from traffic, is well lit, and connects key locations around the neighborhood."
2811,7,164,['neighborhood'],A flexible public transport system that shuttles students from my neighborhood to the school
2812,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
2813,7,164,['neighborhood'],A high-speed rail that goes around the neighborhood into the city.
2814,7,164,['neighborhood'],"a new system in my neighborhood could be bicycle - but have taxi options, so additional seats attached, perhaps rickshaw style. A person would pedal (no motors, so no issues with being on road) and there would be a seat on the back for a rider. There would be a helmet with each rider."
2815,7,164,['neighborhood'],A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
2816,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A new transportation method could be using self driving vehicles. During times when you are needing to pre drink before going to a bar to save money, you find yourself unable to drive to the said bar. With self driving vehicles, you can let the robot do the critical thinking for you to ensure your safe arrival to your friendly neighborhood bar. This would be fun and convenient. This would also reduce the amount of wrecks on a friday and saturday night."
2817,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A new transportation system  can be something somewhat like a train, but a small train like shuttle, which can take others around the neighborhood, easy, fast and no traffic."
2818,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
2819,7,164,['neighborhood'],A new transportation system for our neighborhood could be shared scooters.  The scooters would be open for all to use and stocked at locations around the neighborhood.  You could check them out and return them for less money than the cost of a scooter.
2820,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood could be the use of drones to fly individuals in and around town, or to far off destinations. The drones would fly like helicopters, but can  can also be controlled using a remote control. Unlike a car which can transport several passengers, the drone would be only be able to transport one person."
2821,7,164,['neighborhood'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
2822,7,164,['neighborhood'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
2823,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be similar to a train line, just on a smaller scale. It would pick people up in a series of pods and deposit them at their place of work for a small fee. This new train type line could also be used in the same way that a bus is, to run errands. The new system would have comfortable couch like chairs and be far more acceptable than the current forms of trnasportation availabe."
2824,7,164,['neighborhood'],A new trolley system with free transportation would be beneficial since the neighborhood isn't very big and it would do well for people who could be handicap. I think the new trolley system could be hybrid -- electric and gas -- which most trolleys aren't.
2825,7,164,['neighborhood'],A new way to transport in my neighborhood? I would honestly say cabs. They are not around where I live. But a cheaper way and only in the city. It's mostly just busses and the stops are few and far between.
2826,7,164,['neighborhood'],A pedi cab service similar to Uber. People would sign up to drive people around on their bicycles. It's a small neighborhood and could easily be done. The call service could have a phone app and website to make it easier to schedule pick ups.
2827,7,164,['neighborhood'],A rail that goes back and forth from campus with known arrival times would be ideal for students to travel from campus to their homes and neighborhoods. This would be like a miniature above ground subway.
2828,7,164,['neighborhood'],A skateboard tram that runs on a track through the neighborhood to the local bus stops
2829,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
2830,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A system of neighborhood drivers who form a cooperative and use their own vehicles to provide transportation services. We live in a community of 1875 people in a rural area, it may not be practical, but it is doable."
2831,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A system where there are rails above you and nothing underneath you.

You sit in a cart of sorts and you are guided along near the streets, maybe above the streets or sidewalk.

The railings connect overhead and end at each sidewalk and gives you a nice view of the neighborhood, kind of like a ski-lift."
2832,7,164,['neighborhood'],A trolley would be awesome in my small neighborhood since it already has a decent grid of streets
2833,7,164,['neighborhood'],a vehicle that goes around the neighborhood and offers free homework help for kids.
2834,7,164,['neighborhood'],"An alternate transportation system in my neighborhood would be a free transportation system that can take you anywhere that you like. Paying for transportation is not easy since everybody carries debit or credit cards nowadays. Hardly anybody has change or cash on them. Free transportation would be great, and it should be something other than a bus. It should just be a regular vehicle as well with a friendly driver to take you somewhere."
2835,7,164,['neighborhood'],"An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
2836,7,164,['neighborhood'],"An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
2837,7,164,['neighborhood'],"An extensive network of electric vehicles that run off solar power. They sit out in the sun all day anyway, and can be shared and used as needed by the neighborhood. The neighborhood pays a monthly maintenance fee to use the vehicles. They may be used for shorter city trips."
2838,7,164,['neighborhood'],An idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood would be to use cars with automated driving that would allow the person(s) to input the destination and go about doing other things while the car drove itself to that location.
2839,7,164,['neighborhood'],"An idea I've had is the concept of personal golf carts that are used in malls, country clubs and campuses but having a few of these carts that use alternative energy methods like charging or solar power. 



They would be small and won't go at very high speeds but they could be useful for getting people in the neighborhood around for errands or nearby places while saving them money on gas and helping the environment somewhat.



It could be a small fleet the neighborhood keeps around and they are rented out to the local community for a small fee or monthly payment."
2840,7,164,['neighborhood'],"An underground network system in the neighborhood, like a subway but only bikes and small motorcycles can travel through. This will be a good way to protect against the weather and steer clear of any incoming cars."
2841,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
2842,7,164,['neighborhood'],"autonomous vehicles abound. there are shared autonomous vehicles that can be called by neighborhood members. you may travel to destinations within your town only. the cost is shared by real estate tax. the benefit is a drastic reduction in traffic congestion, as much fewer cars are needed."
2843,7,164,['neighborhood'],Can use a taxi hailing service in my neighborhood to get from one point to another. It is relies on a service car and workers.
2844,7,164,['neighborhood'],"carpooling, so many in our neighborhood go to the same places.  We could develop an app to see who can carpool with who .. state where, when you are going somewhere and people can sign up.. if they can drive or can pay for gas"
2845,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Currently, I live in a small town that has a public transportation system. However, you have to call and wait for the bus to pick you up, instead of waiting at a pre-determined stop, and it can take forever to get where you're going. I propose a busing system that's like the one in bigger cities for my neighborhood. People could still call and wait for a bus, but buses should also stop and pick people up at predetermined stops at regular intervals."
2846,7,164,['neighborhood'],Developing a bike path throughout the neighborhood that goes directly to business locations would encourage more people to ride bikes and drive their cars less.  This bike path could snake all around the city with entries directly to all business locations making it an easy option for people.
2847,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Disperse grocery stores closer to neighborhoods, to avoid long trips to buy milk"
2848,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Driverless cars, it's the only thing I can imagine being different in my neighborhood.  We do not have room for new rail systems."
2849,7,164,['neighborhood'],Each neighborhood gets together to say what time they will be leaving that has a automatic system that will call and tell everyone in the neighborhood or in short distance where they are going and when they are leaving.  That way they can catch a ride with others and not have to guess where or when they are leaving. It could be like a carpool system where everywhere you go it will auto call if that person is gong to another location and you still have room in your vehicle.
2850,7,164,['neighborhood'],Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
2851,7,164,['neighborhood'],"For transportation in my neighborhood we have cars, and buses. The most popular mode of transportation being the four door family sedan type car. Following that it's the minivan and then the four-door trucks. They can be seen whizzing back and forth on the roads causing many traffic jams during peak morning hours."
2852,7,164,['neighborhood'],Future transportation in my neighborhood would be by air. Cars will travel in the air and park on top of roof buildings. Gas would not cost that much and it will be less crowed on the streets.
2853,7,164,['neighborhood'],Future transportation system in my neighborhood could be a electric bicycle taxi system where neighborhood resents can take shorts trips like the grocery store or sending kids off to school.
2854,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Have old school buses converted into Eco friendly vehicles, then have them purchases by large local companies and drive to neighborhoods to pick up workers."
2855,7,164,['neighborhood'],Having a neighborhood run community bus system. It would be exclusively a bus for people in the neighborhood to travel short distances.
2856,7,164,['neighborhood'],Horse and buggy.  A horse and buggy that picks up people and take them on rides in the neighborhood.
2857,7,164,['neighborhood'],Horse and carriage.  Have someone make scheduled stops using a horse and carriage to pick people up and take them around the neighborhood.
2858,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Hoverboard/Segway share: have stations located around the neighborhood where a hoverboard or a segway can be left to charge and then someone else can use it, leaving it at another station for someone else to use."
2859,7,164,['neighborhood'],I believe my neighborhood should have some sort of electronic trolley system.  I can take multiple people throughout the day and network workers to certain destinations and landmarks.
2860,7,164,['neighborhood'],I believe that we should have personalized rail system fro our neighborhood. The whole nei8ghborhhod should have a few of them available to different destinations. When someone wants to go there they hit a button and it sends it to them.
2861,7,164,['neighborhood'],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
2862,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I have no problem visualizing a new mode of transportation in my neighborhood. Years ago coal trains ran behind my house and the old gully is still there where the tracks were. Would love to see them back again, but it will never happen."
2863,7,164,['neighborhood'],I hope to see people in flying vehicles in my neighborhood in the future. I would also like to see more amphibious vehicles.
2864,7,164,['neighborhood'],I imagine a way to ride a school bus to various spots on its route. You would be pre-screened as an adult who could act as a school bus monitor and at the same time gain transportation to a location near the school. It would solve the problem of kids riding unsupervised and give another public transportation option in the neighborhood.
2865,7,164,['neighborhood'],I imagine that instead of transporting with cars we could turn all the roads in our neighborhood into rivers and use boats to get to places.
2866,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I live in a neighborhood near an excellent metro system, but not walkable to it. I would like a people-mover sort of system that travels through the neighborhood making the existing metro station more accessible. Perhaps small cars or pods at the end of each street that travel along an elevated rail directly to the metro station."
2867,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I live in a rural area, it's pretty hilly but it runs along the length of a valley. It would be really nice to have a walking/bike path that connects the residential neighborhood to the commercial district without having the bike/walk on the road. Although it's generally slow traffic, walking on the road is never exactly safe. Especially in the winter. To be able to network together the few towns in the valley too would be very nice."
2868,7,164,['neighborhood'],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town. I can see the current roads changing to smaller lanes made for electric vehicles while most of the transportation needs will be fulfilled with bike and walking paths and personal hoverboard type of transportation.
2869,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I live in a very hilly neighborhood. I suggest a funicular! A funicular is a railway built on a steep hill with tram cars for transport. Put it on one of the hills in the center of the neighborhood. People would be only a short walk (less than 10 minutes), hop on the funicular and it could take them to the church, the school and the neighborhood business district. Bam. No more worrying about going up and down the crazy hills, especially in the winter. Booyah!"
2870,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city. Would take ten minutes max to board and 10-15 minutes to go downtown."
2871,7,164,['neighborhood'],I see a solar powered trolley going around the neighborhood.
2872,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
2873,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think a drone transport system that would carry people, good and other items would be a great service.  An even better idea is if was peer run, meaning run by people in your neighborhood, and all the profits would be split."
2874,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
2875,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think a great idea within my neighborhood would basically to have a moving sidewalk like you would find at an airport.  This would allow people to move about faster than maybe they would walking, so people wouldn't feel the need to get in the car to go down the block to the store."
2876,7,164,['neighborhood'],I think a new transportation that utilizes a type of rail system on the sidewalks that people can easily easily walk throughout the neighborhood - similar to the moving walkways at airports.  Sort of like a conveyor belt for people.
2877,7,164,['neighborhood'],I think my neighborhood and the surrounding city could use some sort of collection of energy efficient trams that can network passengers along the old railways that are no longer in use.
2878,7,164,['neighborhood'],I think my neighborhood could benefit from ride-sharing bikes. We live in a suburb of Boston but technically a City. Not the easiest to get around and a lot to do.
2879,7,164,['neighborhood'],I think my neighborhood would benefit from one of those pedal bike bars for the downtown area. There is a lot of history and what better way to enjoy it than while sipping a nice drink and getting some exercise
2880,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think that a new mod of transportation in my neighborhood would be a electric bike taxi system. It would be an electric bike pulling a carriage that hold up to 3 other people. The system will travel from people's houses to their work place, local shopping centers and local entertainment places."
2881,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think that a trolly system would work well in phoenix.  They would run frequently, be smaller than a bus and go into more neighborhoods."
2882,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think that some sort of charging commuter car should be parked in every neighborhood. People could coordinate commute times and use electric cars instead of gas, in exchange they pay $1 a day to drive the car per person."
2883,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I think there should be free neighborhood circulators that stop at significant shopping centers, landmarks, or services, that run throughout the day. I think they should be brightly colored bus-like vehicles."
2884,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I was thinking that since the city I live in has a decently sized river, to save money, be cost effective, and lower power/energy usage, we can ferry people and personnel to central districts of the city and my neighborhood. Maybe the ferries/boat could be turbine powered to be more energy efficient."
2885,7,164,['neighborhood'],I wish my neighborhood had a giant conveyor belt for going to all the main places downtown.  It would help the older people as well be convenient.  It would have to be waterproof and covered.  It could run all along the one side of the main intersections without ever having to cross.
2886,7,164,['neighborhood'],I would enjoy having a limousine service in the neighborhood. That would be a safe and comfortable mode of transportation.
2887,7,164,['neighborhood'],I would imagine a monorail type of situation.  With frequent stops around the neighborhood so everyone was able to get on relatively near their home.  It would move quickly and make stops at the nearby schools and stores.
2888,7,164,['neighborhood'],I would imagine a street car type system that would connect each neighborhood.
2889,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I would like a city trolley. The trolley would travel around the city several times a day, taking and picking up residents from the major shopping areas. The trolley stops should be no more than two blocks from any neighborhood."
2890,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I would like for a train to be in my neighborhood.   IT would go right down the sides of our main streets.   There is a train currently, but you have to drive far to it.   There should be more trains, not just one or two."
2891,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
2892,7,164,['neighborhood'],I would like to see an expanded light rail system with more of a neighborhood connection.  Right now our light rail pretty much just connects the Downtown core with the airport.
2893,7,164,['neighborhood'],I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
2894,7,164,['neighborhood'],"I would love for there to a more intergrated train system in my city (specifically my neighborhood.) I'd love to be able to hop on a train (or streetcar) and be able to transfer to a larger rail system that would take me to other cities, etc. Something like what european cities have."
2895,7,164,['neighborhood'],I would love if my neighborhood had a rail system that worked from magnets and floated along the rail at high speeds.  I wish that the cars were individual and that I could get in and select from a list of destinations.  I would like my own car and to be able to bring my dogs with me.  It would be fast and smooth and work with minimal power.
2896,7,164,['neighborhood'],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
2897,7,164,['neighborhood'],I'd like to see the railroad tracks by our house be repurposed as a walking and biking route for the neighborhood.  It would be really sweet if they could use that and carry the corridor all the way to the nearest town and shopping area.
2898,7,164,['neighborhood'],If we had taxis in our neighborhood had a rewards card program where you can earn free rides.
2899,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Imagine streets that are great for bicycling, walking, taking transit and just for enjoying in our neighborhood"
2900,7,164,['neighborhood'],"In many neighborhoods, stop signs are ignored. I believe switching to yield signs, where ideally suitable, is needed and adding 'bus stops' for local schools that do not hinder traffic."
2901,7,164,['neighborhood'],In my neighborhood i imagine a trolley on solar powered magnetic train tracks. This keeps the trolley moving at all times but keeps anyone from getting hurt like children.
2902,7,164,['neighborhood'],In my neighborhood I think the best type of transportation system would be an elevated railway like a tram at disney world it would make commuting between neighboring cities far easier and the technology would make commutes more timely.
2903,7,164,['neighborhood'],In my neighborhood it would be like a monorail system. Something that you could get on at one stop and take it to another are you would want to go. Connecting locations you would visit.
2904,7,164,['neighborhood'],"In my neighborhood, any kind of public transportation would be innovative. Due to the apparent stigma of such, I would propose a lovely electric-run ""uber coach"" instead of the big ugly city bus. This could be as simple as a mini-van and could deliver us suffering commuters of Southern California from a few select and regular pick-up spots to bigger, car-pool mega spots at various freeway points."
2905,7,164,['neighborhood'],"In my neighborhood, any public transportation would  be new. We could make rentable bicycles that are in a convenient location"
2906,7,164,['neighborhood'],"In my neighborhood, I would like to see some sort of updated streetcar system with solar panels on the top of the street cats,, some sort of energy capture technology on the tracks."
2907,7,164,['neighborhood'],"In my neighborhood, there's not a lot of space, so I'd have to go with covered bikes of some sort, or one of those neat bike trollys. That would be a neat way to get around and exercise."
2908,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Instead of paving trucks coming through the neighborhoods, laying down new asphalt, it would be soap trucks.  The streets would be lined with giant tarps, and people would slip and slide to their destinations on specially crafted slip and sliders.  They would look sort of like a canoe, but with a flat bottom.  I think underneath the tarp, there would be air pockets that sensed whenever an object passed over them.  Whenever an object passes over the air pockets, they rapidly self inflate, thereby pushing the slip and slide canoe further and faster."
2909,7,164,['neighborhood'],It would be a free system (every family in the neighborhood would have to contribute $300-$400 as a one time fee). Then the bus would run through the neighborhood every hour and take you to anywhere in the neighborhood that you need to go! You would be able to text the driver before hand of where you are going.
2910,7,164,['neighborhood'],It would be an electric tram that would ride in the center turning lane of my neighborhood.  It would look like a two-car train that would seat around 40 people.  It would make frequent stops at major intersections and shopping centers in the neighborhood by pulling off to the side in the bike lane. It would have solar panels on the top to help off-set the electricity use.
2911,7,164,['neighborhood'],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
2912,7,164,['neighborhood'],It would be cool it we had a monorail type system throughout the neighborhood that does a simple circle and takes kids or adults from the neighboorhood into the town/school area.
2913,7,164,['neighborhood'],It would be effective to create a bike club in my neighborhood.  We would choose at least 1 day a week to ride our bikes to work decreasing neighborhood traffic and air pollution.  This bike club would host meetings once a month and reward people who rode the most days to work that month incentivizing people to ride more often.
2914,7,164,['neighborhood'],"It would be great if we had raised, walkable paths all throughout my neighborhood. They would be similar to bridges, only not as high and not as wide, that way people could walk or run for exercise and not worry about being struck by vehicles."
2915,7,164,['neighborhood'],"It would be great to have a bike share program in my neighborhood. Just have a couple bike lock stations and have the city get us a bunch of bikes, and just use the bikes as we need them and park then when we're done."
2916,7,164,['neighborhood'],"It would be hard to have a viable system in my neighborhood, because this area is so scattered. I think the best idea would be a bikeshare; inexpensive access to bikes would be a great idea! The bigger issue would be making our area bike-friendly. That's the part the requires creativity. We could add extra lanes and then add over/underpasses at intersections to make bikes not just inexpensive, but even more time-effective than driving."
2917,7,164,['neighborhood'],It would be like a super fast tram or train so the people in my neighborhood could get to run errands without their cars. We could have stops at the entrances to the neighborhood and the tracks could just run down the street.
2918,7,164,['neighborhood'],"It would be small individual electric golf cart-like cars that run along the edge of the sidewalks every couple of minutes that people can hop into to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, post office, etc.  they operate from out of a common neighborhood ""hub"" so each system covers a small area.  People can just call one from an app on their smart phone, they are charged a small fee, then after the trip, the cart remains in one area until it is called again or it returns to the hub to be charged."
2919,7,164,['neighborhood'],It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.
2920,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Kind of a monorail system that goes from stops in neighborhoods and takes people to a stop near the stores, etc.  Open top with a cover, no need to heat or cool, wouldn't run in extreme weather."
2921,7,164,['neighborhood'],Light rail connecting outer neighborhoods to the city would be good for everyone for jobs and business.
2922,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Making a Difference in Your Neighborhood: Using Community Decision-Making to Improve the Lives of Children, Youth and Families is  for Local Decision Making Learning Guides"
2923,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Maybe a neighborhood car service where people pitch in a certain amount per month, and then they can order a car to drive them anywhere in the neighborhood that they need to go to"
2924,7,164,['neighborhood'],Maybe a service where high school students (age 16 and up) who have their license could opt to take an hour out of the school day to drive people around in the neighborhood (who need a ride) and the people would pay a discounted rate.
2925,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Maybe for anyone who has a driver's license, and needs extra money, there could be a service that is kind of like an Uber but it serves a neighborhood specifically. And the drivers would be people in the neighborhood who need extra money, and want to do part time work (on an as needed basis.)"
2926,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Maybe for college students who need college credit, their neighborhood could set up a ""class"" that meets twice a week for an hour each, and the licensed student could drive whoever around who needs it. And they could receive college credit for it!"
2927,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Maybe like a neighborhood taxi that would be assigned to a specific neighborhood, and would circulate and pick up people at a discounted rate!"
2928,7,164,['neighborhood'],"maybe to save money, for rides throughout the neighborhood, it could just be a horse and carriage. someone could donate a few horses, and a few carriages, and everything would be for free"
2929,7,164,['neighborhood'],Mini bus services around the neighborhood covering the residential area so that single rides can be reduced
2930,7,164,['neighborhood'],Moving bench that is connected to tracks to help older people travel short distances within their neighborhoods.
2931,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Moving platforms that function like traincars and moving sidewalks put together. They would go above roads, have railings on each side and be like busses with bus stops. You could buy a thing like a bus pass that allows you x number of rides, so that you don't have to have cash on your person to be able to get on it. It would run from neighborhoods to main city areas and only be running when people call for it/use it to save money on electricity/gas/whatever"
2932,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My idea alternative transportation in the neighborhood would be horseback. There would be nice safe wide equestrian trails throughout allowing you to visit neighbors, go to the convenience or grocery store which would have hitching posts. Motorized vehicles would be limited to passenger cars/trucks."
2933,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood is a series of really big tubes, with padding, and occasionally air holes, with mesh filters to prevent bugs and large debris from getting in.  The tubes would be places alongside all the streets, and be at a constant forward vacuum, with enough lessening of suction to allow people to grasp a handle at their stop and get out.   (If you miss your stop, you just ride around until it comes up again, pushing yourself towards the right tube as it comes towards you.)



Collision between travelers would need to be solved, as well as how to clean up any errant body fluids left by travelers; perhaps a daily purge at midnight, where the suction could be increased exponentially and all materials dumped in a pile, on a rotating schedule, on different people's lawns.   



This system has the benefit of a very low carbon footprint, and lends itself well to spontaneous exclamations of 'cowabunga'.  



Implementation note: This idea may require anti-gravity research, in addition to a lot of suction."
2934,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My idea is re-creating the Trolly car, they would go through neighborhoods and people can hop on and off as it slowly moves."
2935,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My idea would be to use a moving belt (like used in airport terminals) instead of sidewalks to get around my neighborhood. I live is a small town (population about 500), so it would encourage people to drive less to get to destinations that are close to their homes."
2936,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My neighborhood added an above ground train similar to the ""L"" in Chicago.  It runs along the highways bringing people downtown from the suburbs.  It does a few loops downtown and runs near the major companies to get people to work.  It is much cheaper and more convenient than driving downtown and parking."
2937,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My neighborhood currently has no bike lanes, so I would imagine a system with renewable transportation integrated into the layout. Spaces for bikes, electric car re-charging stations, etc."
2938,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My neighborhood filled with uber drives. However, there is no cost assoicated with the transit it is all provided by the town. It would be like new york city (think of cabs), however nice black cars everywhere and someone can hop in to any one they want free of charge. Baisically be like public transit with uber and they will take you wherever you want."
2939,7,164,['neighborhood'],"my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops. People will be able to travel to any part of the world without going through airports and flight connections. There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
2940,7,164,['neighborhood'],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
2941,7,164,['neighborhood'],My neighborhood has no transportation system. So a simple bus would help.
2942,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
2943,7,164,['neighborhood'],My neighborhood needs a car share system between individuals. It would be similar to Uber but you would be able to drive someone else's car for a monthly fee.
2944,7,164,['neighborhood'],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
2945,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Not just in my neighborhood but metro-wide, my city recently established time share bicycles people can rent and ride when they have a short distance to travel. The bikes are all of the same design, having a large sturdy frame painted light blue, three gears (the gear box is inside the rear wheel axle, and LED blinker lights for safety. Necessarily, it's a one-size-fits-all arrangement; there's no way to raise or lower the seat unless you carry your own tools around with you, so if you're a tall person and use one of these bikes you'll be knocking yourself in the chin with your knees."
2946,7,164,['neighborhood'],peer to peer sharing of vehicles within a neighborhood. there is accountability with keeping the vehicles clean since it is shared within a community.
2947,7,164,['neighborhood'],Segway rental stations placed all over the neighborhood.  Just rent out a segway for a given amount of time and return it to the nearest station when finished with use.  Segways are relatively low profile and can easily be used by most people.
2948,7,164,['neighborhood'],Small train track.  A small train that works on tracks set in your neighborhood.
2949,7,164,['neighborhood'],"The future transportation system in me neighborhood is going to consist of driverless vehicles that hover and travel with the help of magnetism. The vehicles have built in solar panels that operate throughout the city 24/7. These vehicles all have routines they follow everyday so people just have to transfer according to where they want to go. On the other hand, if people want to own their own vehicle then it is possible. They can travel where ever they want to and all they have to do is to recharge their solar battery in the sunlight."
2950,7,164,['neighborhood'],"The future transportation system in my neighborhood is called air cars. They were created in an effort to reduce carbon footprints and try to save our planet. These vehicles are much more lighter than regular cars and can be upgraded to fly. The best thing about these cars is that they operate solely on air. What is even better is that there is a filter that intakes air and cleans it by trapping dirty air in a compartment only able to be removed by manufacturers. This is our last ditch effort to save the Earth, so buy a Clean Car."
2951,7,164,['neighborhood'],The future transportation system in my neighborhood would possibly incorporate traffic light systems that would detect the amount of traffic and flow to better keep traffic moving and prevent long lines and wait times at intersections therefor reducing trip times and automobile emissions.
2952,7,164,['neighborhood'],"The neighborhood I live in has alley ways behind our properties. So when getting kids to school in our town, we could have some sort of trolley or train-like vehicle that could go up and down the alleys picking up the kids. This would be quick and efficient and the kids would want to go to school because it would be fun and exciting."
2953,7,164,['neighborhood'],The neighborhood needs a rail system that runs adjacent to the highway. This would go from major city to major city with the same stops as for those that drive.
2954,7,164,['neighborhood'],"The new transportation in my neighborhood is by teleportation! There will be a number of discs on the floor, coated in white paint, that people will step on and be teleported to wherever they would like to be. There is a catch - you have to do jumping jacks to get the teleporter started!"
2955,7,164,['neighborhood'],"The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
2956,7,164,['neighborhood'],"The transportation system in my neighborhood consists of each person driving their own cars. Occasionally, people will carpool, but there is no public transportation and walking is not feasable."
2957,7,164,['neighborhood'],"There are many back roads and residential routes around my neighborhood, so speed isn't as much of an issue to keep pace with traffic. I'd imagine a fleet of scooters that could be rented cheaply and easily could help residents get around town without much issue."
2958,7,164,['neighborhood'],"There are solar powered buses in my neighborhood which are 100% sustainable and operate autonomously, very much like the commuter trams at some airports such as Miami International Airport. These require no labor, and as such, have no human element involved in decisionmaking. As they are programmed to stop at intervals (designated by where the bus stops would be) there is a set time to off-load and pick up customers. OF course, handicapped and large groups can press a certain button which would allow more time and/or ramps to deploy."
2959,7,164,['neighborhood'],"There is no public transportation in my neighborhood. We do not even have sidewalks for pedestrians. It is a major problem that I wish could be fixed, but no one cares about rural cities."
2960,7,164,['neighborhood'],"This is about car pooling. As our residences are located far away from our work place, we, in our neighborhood have passed a resolution that to share our sitting in our cars (each a day in a week) to reduce pollution, save money, etc. and it works good too. :-)"
2961,7,164,['neighborhood'],"This new transportation system is a bullet train in the sky, able to span around the neighborhood with up to 700 passengers in under two minutes. It's sleek silver coat is never late, and always early to make sure everyone gets where they need to go. The rails float there in the sky, ready to carry this majestic beauty to the ends of the neighborhood making sure everyone is early"
2962,7,164,['neighborhood'],This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
2963,7,164,['neighborhood'],Train on tracks.  A small and slow train on preset track for people to enjoy the neighborhood.
2964,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Tunnels, a series of tunnels to and from various nodes around the neighborhood, with access at most corners. These would have flat conveyors to make movement faster than normal walking much like in airports but also be underground to be out of the way and avoid unpleasant weather."
2965,7,164,['neighborhood'],"Ultimate monkey bars.  People are too fat in my area, forcing them to travel via monkey bars across the neighborhood should help not only with emission decrease, but weight decrease as well!  There will just be an overhead system running the lengths of the sidewalks at 7 foot high so no one gets hurt if they fall."
2966,7,164,['neighborhood'],underground subway that extends to all major neighborhoods. It would be fast and convenient to use.
2967,7,164,['neighborhood'],We are planning to buy a battery car forthe transportation in our neighborhood. By using the battery car there will be no bad effects in our atmosphere and also it will not populated our environment.
2968,7,164,['neighborhood'],We could really use a ride sharing option in my neighborhood.  I suggest having a neighborhood website that allows workers to post their work location and schedule so that workers can meet up and arrange to share a ride to work.
2969,7,164,['neighborhood'],We want to use battery car in our neighborhood because it is has no smoke and also it will not affect the environment and will make us safe   .
2970,7,164,['neighborhood'],what is needed is a tubular powered zipline based transportation system. a combination of pnewumatic and electric power will propel people from place to place in a similar manner to a ski lift except it would just be a small tube that has a chain of sorts running in it along the sidewalks. all you would have to do is to have a harness on and when you need to go to one of the destinations you hook on to the line that is color coded for your destination and cruise on down there. Not the most comfortable way to travel but the infrastructure for a neighborhood would be relatively inexpensive.
2971,7,164,['neighborhood'],When I imagine future transportation in my neighborhood I visualize the vehicles of today with more advanced technology. I image that the vehicles will be able to drive themselves and all that is needed is for a person to input their destination and sit back. I think that the interior of the vehicles will be the biggest changes because these vehicles will allow people to sit back and relax. I think that the interior will be comfortable seats and have TVs to pass the time. Overall I imagine future transportation being someone similar to today but with less demand on people.
2972,7,164,['neighborhood'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
2973,8,141,['drive'],A bunch of self driving cars that will replace buses and taxis. The will have free wifi and be very cheap.
2974,8,141,['drive'],"A car pooling app. Non-drivers and those looking for regular rides who normally carpool would join the community and hook up with drivers who are going to their general destination. There would be a monthly fee, which would lowered and even be removed if someone drives/uses their car enough. For example, it's $5 per month, and every time YOU drive it goes down by .50 cents. There's incentive for both non-drivers (a small fee for rides) and drivers (free membership, maybe some gas reimbursement)."
2975,8,141,['drive'],A electric scooter sharing program for getting around town without having to drive a car and use too much gas or take up too much space.
2976,8,141,['drive'],"A fare based system would allow heavy car users to pay more and light ones to pay less for gas, tolls, etc.  Their car will have a gps tracker to see where and when they go (downtown, rush hour, etc.)  This will help the people who don't need to drive as much and tax the ones that are always on the road."
2977,8,141,['drive'],"A fleet of cheap, reliable, automated taxi cars. The cars would drive automatically after an input was made for the destination. These cars would be self charging with paint that has solar energy potential."
2978,8,141,['drive'],"A form of alternative transportation would be in the form of an SUV crossed with a 4wheeler. However, it would need to be affordable and able to be driven on main roads."
2979,8,141,['drive'],A going to town app. In a rural area like where I live sometimes you avoid going to town because you don't have a ride or you just don't feel you can justify driving all that way just to run a quick errand. Enter an app that connects you to people along your travel rout who also need to go into town. You could flag yourself as offering a ride or needing a ride.
2980,8,141,['drive'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram.

2981,8,141,['drive'],"A hitchhiking app where everyone has a profile with ""reviews"" from other drivers and hitchhikers. If you're walking somewhere you can turn on the app and if someone else with the app happens to drive by they can pick you up."
2982,8,141,['drive'],"A network of green transportation for rent. You insert coins and it releases a bike, a skateboard, a scooter or some other form of efficient transportation. You drive it to your destination and once you deliver it to the hotpspot you can get your money back, if it is in good condition."
2983,8,141,['drive'],A network of publicly available electric cars will drive around the city in the most efficient manner possible. People will use apps to call a car to get them =from one of many pickup spots and drop them off before they go on the next passenger.
2984,8,141,['drive'],"A network of self driving cars on demand.  You set your pickup time and location via app, as well as destination and desired arrival time."
2985,8,141,['drive'],"A network of self driving cars that are owned by the community. When you need one, you just summon one like Uber."
2986,8,141,['drive'],A new carpool system. You get together with a group of people at a park and ride. Park your car there and commute in a van with a group of people to work. This save gas and some of you can nap while the other is driving.
2987,8,141,['drive'],"A new transportation method could be using self driving vehicles. During times when you are needing to pre drink before going to a bar to save money, you find yourself unable to drive to the said bar. With self driving vehicles, you can let the robot do the critical thinking for you to ensure your safe arrival to your friendly neighborhood bar. This would be fun and convenient. This would also reduce the amount of wrecks on a friday and saturday night."
2988,8,141,['drive'],A new transportation system.... Self driving cars/ trolleys (absolutely no tracks or special lanes for the trolley just self driving)
2989,8,141,['drive'],"a new type of rail system with certain drop off points, but the rail system is above the road so it doesnt interfere with people driving cars."
2990,8,141,['drive'],A online map real time of the buses and trains the area. Buses and trains aren't usually on time and having real on time traffic will show if its a bad bad to drive.
2991,8,141,['drive'],A pedi cab service similar to Uber. People would sign up to drive people around on their bicycles. It's a small neighborhood and could easily be done. The call service could have a phone app and website to make it easier to schedule pick ups.
2992,8,141,['drive'],"A pod/train system that runs on the shoulder of roads. It would be more active than typical buses, and be more personal in that there can be no more than 4 passengers. It would run on a track or in the future it would would run with automatic sensing software and would drive itself."
2993,8,141,['drive'],"A public transport system with self-driving cars. You go online, select your destination and then order a self driving car to pick you up."
2994,8,141,['drive'],"A rail cart, that is powered by friction and capturing the head it produces while being driven down the rail, it starts with a simple pedal of a bike to create enough momentum and friction to start the process going and then as soon as you produce enough energy to get it moving, it will continue to produce and move forward till you press the brakes. BAM!"
2995,8,141,['drive'],A rail system that is build from the ground up. This would be capable of high speeds typically not able to travel when driving or on another train. This would make work transit much faster.
2996,8,141,['drive'],"A Railway system for cars, like something out of minority report. You can still drive on the roads but the speed limit is controlled and there is never any accidents because you input your destination into a program in the individual cars and let the railway system get you there."
2997,8,141,['drive'],A self driving lawn mower.  Use the technology for self driving cars to create a self driving lawn mower.
2998,8,141,['drive'],"A social platform similar to facebook related to all things travel. People would be able to connect with others and find people traveling the same route. One person would volunteer to drive and would pick everyone up, and their cards are automatically charged the rate in which gas costs along with depreciation of vehicle. If 3 riders, each pay 1/3.. 4 riders pay 1/4, etc."
2999,8,141,['drive'],"A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."
3000,8,141,['drive'],A system of fast moving conveyor belts that help move people quickly instead of walking and driving short distances.
3001,8,141,['drive'],"A tax write-off for driving strangers to work.  This way, the stranger doesn't have to pay for the ride, the person driving still gets ample benefit for dropping someone off on the way to their job and the like.  There could be a little schedule online you fill out saying where you're going, and at what time.  



People who are interested in being helpful can go to this site, find out whats on their way, and scoop up the people.  Think uber, but instead of money, just get a dollar or two back on your taxes for every single person you pick up.



You'd be able to rate the drivers, and in order for them to be eligible for the write off, they'd need to maintain a high rating.  If anyone abuses it, or misses picking people up, they are barred from using it for a few months."
3002,8,141,['drive'],A taxi service where self-driving cars can be dispatched to a client which then drive the client to their destination and then return to HQ.
3003,8,141,['drive'],"An app that worked somewhat like Uber, but is for ride-sharing/car pooling.  You put in your destination, whether you can drive or not, what time you need to be to your destination, and an acceptable range for the location.  The app would look for others with similar destinations or destinations en-route for others as well as the best route to minimize drive time, but maximize people getting to their destination.  Then the app would calculate a fair percentage of the ride cost for each person based on their destination, travel distance, etc.  Public transportation here isn't great because we are so spread out.  After each ride you could rate other passengers and the driver and those ratings could be used to filter out bad users entirely or just below a certain rating level."
3004,8,141,['drive'],"An automated system of cabs. Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."
3005,8,141,['drive'],"An autonomous car service. This would require the building and investing into self driving cars. You would have a mobile app you can call and request a car and one is immediately dispatched to you. Using your phone you tell it where you want to go. It navigates there. Best of all, this would be free - or very cheap."
3006,8,141,['drive'],An idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood would be to use cars with automated driving that would allow the person(s) to input the destination and go about doing other things while the car drove itself to that location.
3007,8,141,['drive'],"As a socially awkward recluse who doesn't drive, I want to be able to call an automated system for a driver-less taxi. I want the option to pay online via debit/credit, gift card or Paypal or have the option to insert bills into the car door before being able to enter. I'd like to be able to pick my music genres for the ride as well."
3008,8,141,['drive'],"Automated taxi service. Would have several dispatch stations in key areas of city. Person could call for a ride from an app on their phone and it would send a car to them. The software could calculate rate for the trip and make you pay before as a confirmation before sending a car out. Car could then drive customer to said destination.  Self driveable cars that could provide a much better service than the often RUDE cab drivers could provide. Plus, I trust a robot way more than some of these morons driving!"
3009,8,141,['drive'],Bike pathway bridges above the city. These pathways could connect schools and business and making them convenient would encourage more people to ride and less driving.
3010,8,141,['drive'],"CAR IS GOOD FOR FAMILY DRIVE.

SCOOTER IS BEST FOR SINGLE ONE

BUS IS SUITABLE FOR LONG TRAVELLING

TRAIN IS BEST FOR LONG TRAVELLING WITH FAMILY

BICYCLES ARE MAINLY USED FOR EXERCISE AND SCHOOL CHILDREN"
3011,8,141,['drive'],"carpooling, so many in our neighborhood go to the same places.  We could develop an app to see who can carpool with who .. state where, when you are going somewhere and people can sign up.. if they can drive or can pay for gas"
3012,8,141,['drive'],Cars that can connect their GPS's so when they are all going to similar locations they can switch on auto drive and so all the computers can drive automatically. Once the closest stop comes around it'll make it so you have to drive the rest of the way.
3013,8,141,['drive'],"Cars that can drive themselves, but people don't own them. They're a service provided by the city and you sign up for it and call when you need a car and the nearest one comes to you"
3014,8,141,['drive'],"Conveyor belts on the sidewalks, similar to the ones on the airports, wouldn't be a bad idea. This would be perfect if you live near lots of stores, like a grocery store, drug stores, post offices, shopping centers, etc. This will cut back on driving."
3015,8,141,['drive'],Developing a bike path throughout the neighborhood that goes directly to business locations would encourage more people to ride bikes and drive their cars less.  This bike path could snake all around the city with entries directly to all business locations making it an easy option for people.
3016,8,141,['drive'],Every car would be able to hover or fly. Every car that runs off gasoline will be rare to find and all the cars have a feature that are able to drive themselves. Even motorcycles will be something that you find in a museum.
3017,8,141,['drive'],Everything runs on automated self driving cars.  Normal cars are not allowed on the road.  Everything will run smoothly since it is computer operated and parking spaces won't be needed.  Bicyclists will no longer have to worry.
3018,8,141,['drive'],"Get some large vans and people who are going to the same general area to work can all ride together.  They take turns driving.  It'll be like kids' school buses but for adults.  It'll save money and help bond co-workers together.  There will be enough room for a lot of people so the chances of an incident are slim.  It'll also help when it's bad weather because some people are afraid to drive in it and this would ease some of that stress.  Plus, they could all share in the maintenance and gas for the bus/car so that could save them a lot of money."
3019,8,141,['drive'],Group carpools to work.  There could be an app that puts you in contact with people who work at the same company you work at or in close proximity to your work location.  The app would allow drivers to sign up to drive to work and with a rotating schedule this would cut down the amount of driving that any one single person would have to do.
3020,8,141,['drive'],Have a monorail system around town. It'll reduce pollution because people will have fun using it instead of driving their cars.
3021,8,141,['drive'],"Have driverless cars available for instant calls.

The cars would be driving around until someone requests it or parked in a parking lot until called."
3022,8,141,['drive'],"Have old school buses converted into Eco friendly vehicles, then have them purchases by large local companies and drive to neighborhoods to pick up workers."
3023,8,141,['drive'],Having cars that drive themselves come and pick you up and take you where you need to go
3024,8,141,['drive'],Hyperloop:  essentially a super fast subway in a pressurized tube like they use at the drive up to a bank to send things back and forth only on a scale large enough for people to ride in
3025,8,141,['drive'],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
3026,8,141,['drive'],"I live in a chicago suburb and I believe that driverless cars are the future.  But what I actually prefer is everyone driving their own vehicle, what i actually hope happens in the future is that licenses are much harder to get...there are so many people out there with no clue of the rules of the road and it is hazardous to everyone around them."
3027,8,141,['drive'],"I live in a snowy climate, so there are a lot of times that we can't drive our cars anywhere because of all the snow. So a snowmobile taxi might work."
3028,8,141,['drive'],I live in a town right on the ocean and there are many canals here. I think a canoe taxi service would be really convenient and fun. It wouldn't get people to their desired locations super fast but it would allow people to travel leisurely and enjoy the scenery along the way. It would also be really healthy for the people driving the canoes and help them to stay fit.
3029,8,141,['drive'],"I live in a very rural area that doesn't get bus service because of low population. My idea would be a bus service that runs on the same premise as a taxi service... when someone in the area would need a ride, the bus would alter its route to pick up a passenger. That way, the remote area could be serviced by mass transit, yet wouldn't have to waste fuel or money driving to the remote area all of the time. These requests could be put in via phone, web portal, or e-mail."
3030,8,141,['drive'],"I live on an army base. There are hundreds of vehicles that just sit around and collect rust, and it would be wonderful if the military could find some way to rent these vehicles out to the public. This would create income for individual units and help add to their budget, as well as providing vehicles to civilians who need them and even potentially drawing in interested persons who would otherwise never have driven a military vehicle."
3031,8,141,['drive'],I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
3032,8,141,['drive'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
3033,8,141,['drive'],"I think a method that would improve the transportation system would be to change how turn lanes are handled in America. Overseas, to turn left, you veer off to a lane on the right that comes to a stop so that you don't block traffic waiting to turn and then when it is clear, you drive across the street onto the road you were going to turn onto."
3034,8,141,['drive'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
3035,8,141,['drive'],"I think teleportation would be awesome. Wouldn't need cars anymore, save on oil and fumes in the environment. People would be happier because they wouldn't be stuck in traffic or have to drive hours to see long distance family members."
3036,8,141,['drive'],"I think that some sort of charging commuter car should be parked in every neighborhood. People could coordinate commute times and use electric cars instead of gas, in exchange they pay $1 a day to drive the car per person."
3037,8,141,['drive'],I think that there should be a way to get bugs off a windshield without harming the paint job on a car.  It should be a spray while you are driving much like windshield wiper fluid
3038,8,141,['drive'],I think there should be bikes that you can easily rent. You can get them in the major shopping areas and drive them around town to get excercise as well as helping to use less gasoline.
3039,8,141,['drive'],"I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
3040,8,141,['drive'],"I would like for a train to be in my neighborhood.   IT would go right down the sides of our main streets.   There is a train currently, but you have to drive far to it.   There should be more trains, not just one or two."
3041,8,141,['drive'],"I would like to see a short-term car rental service with semi-autonomous driving. For example, if I needed to go to the airport and didn't want to leave my current car in a parking lot their I could rent a car that I could summon with a smartphone app. The car would be able autonomously drive directly to me or a location I choose through the app. After I was at the location of my choosing and no longer needed the car, I could then use the app to send the car away."
3042,8,141,['drive'],"I would like to see all self driving cars, driving at top speeds because human error and crashes have been removed from the equation. So everyone can get to their destination five, maybe ten times as fast, without a significant infrastructure overhaul."
3043,8,141,['drive'],"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
3044,8,141,['drive'],"I would love to see a social network for people that work for a certain business. This social network would allow you to find rides from other employees that live in your area. Every business would have an account at this website, and employees who want to pick up other employees can volunteer. Maybe a $5 fee per person each week to account for gas money, but it could be like it would tell you who lives within 10 miles from you that works where you do, and you can ride share or carpool with them. It would be almost like a social network where you can talk to other employees you don't know and then you can ride together or take turns driving."
3045,8,141,['drive'],"I would love to see an Uber type of program but for doctor appointments. Where the doctor's office has drivers who are willing to pick up patients and drop them back off at home. Maybe like 1 person driving in a city and just bringing the patients to the doctor so that people won't have to drive to the doctor, especially older people."
3046,8,141,['drive'],"I would love to see some kind of computer-operated taxi service in my city. The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
3047,8,141,['drive'],"I would really like to see separate lanes for scooters in my area.  A lot more people are commuting this way, and it would be good if it was a safer way to drive."
3048,8,141,['drive'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
3049,8,141,['drive'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
3050,8,141,['drive'],"In the future, self driving cabs can be summoned via mobile phone, to pick up the driver and take them to a particular destination via a touchscreen or other similar interface located inside the vehicle.  Some difficulty may occur if the passenger is unsure of the address of his or her destination, but a trained attendant can be called to determine the location for the passenger."
3051,8,141,['drive'],"In the interest of reducing traffic and accidents, a new series of self-driving only roads and lanes are opened.  On these roads, ONLY self driving cars are authorized to drive, and on them there are no speed limits (not that the self-driving cars would be going that much faster than normal). Unfettered by the chaos of common roads and the limitations of human judgement, these exclusively self-driving vehicle areas allow the navigational AIs to coordinate for an optimally fast and efficient journey."
3052,8,141,['drive'],Individual cars on a track that you can program to take you where you want without having to drive.
3053,8,141,['drive'],It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
3054,8,141,['drive'],"It would be great if we could improve the pubic transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road. I would like to see self driving buses as well as bus only lanes and self driving cars. No manually controlled cars would be allowed and because of this hopefully the roads will be safer because most accidents and caused by human error. We could have the speed limits increased as well because self driving cars can ""see"" a lot father ahead than humans."
3055,8,141,['drive'],"It would be hard to have a viable system in my neighborhood, because this area is so scattered. I think the best idea would be a bikeshare; inexpensive access to bikes would be a great idea! The bigger issue would be making our area bike-friendly. That's the part the requires creativity. We could add extra lanes and then add over/underpasses at intersections to make bikes not just inexpensive, but even more time-effective than driving."
3056,8,141,['drive'],"It would be this, maybe people who are in prison (for misdemeanors) could get some sunlight in the da, and drive around people in the neighorhood who need rides!"
3057,8,141,['drive'],"Juvenile delinquets could drive the elderly around for 1-2 hrs a day, and that could be a part of their community service."

3059,8,141,['drive'],"Maybe a neighborhood car service where people pitch in a certain amount per month, and then they can order a car to drive them anywhere in the neighborhood that they need to go to"
3060,8,141,['drive'],Maybe a service where high school students (age 16 and up) who have their license could opt to take an hour out of the school day to drive people around in the neighborhood (who need a ride) and the people would pay a discounted rate.
3061,8,141,['drive'],"Maybe for college students who need college credit, their neighborhood could set up a ""class"" that meets twice a week for an hour each, and the licensed student could drive whoever around who needs it. And they could receive college credit for it!"
3062,8,141,['drive'],"Moving sidewalks all over the city would be amazing. People could hop on and even sit and get to their destination.  They'd be like the ones in airports, but they would go faster.  Some could even run into and through tubes so people would be protected in bad weather.  Something like a gerbil habitat would be amazing.  I think it would promote people walking instead of driving.  Or, just standing on the moving sidewalks.  It would reduce pollution if people took things like this around the city."
3063,8,141,['drive'],"My idea is a combination of self driving cars, rideshare and a train. Commuters would pay for a ticket and a line of connected self driving cars would take commuters going the same route/direction to a certain dropoff point, like a train does. Then when the string of cars reaches the stop point, each passenger can enter their desired destination into the touchpad screen in the car and they would be driven to their individual destinations. The self driving cars would break off individually from the train to take these passengers, then they'd return on their own to the ""train station"" to go pick up more passengers."
3064,8,141,['drive'],"My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."
3065,8,141,['drive'],My idea is to build an app for uber drivers that show all the short cuts to a location. Even if they have to drive through residential areas. The app will calculate the shortest distance and time depending on traffic.
3066,8,141,['drive'],My idea is to have a service like zipcar in which someone rents the use of a car by paying a monthly fee except that it would be mopeds for individuals or something larger like a pick up truck.  Just more options than a small smart car.  I used to live in Tokyo and driving a car there was awful but not something like a moped or motorcycle because they could ride in between the cars.  A larger vehicle like a pickup truck would be good for people who need to rent something to haul furniture or something like that but don't want to drive all the way to a car rental place or Lowe's to get the truck.  Everything would be rentable using an app and the cars would feature opening the doors and starting the cars through the app itself.
3067,8,141,['drive'],"My idea would be to use a moving belt (like used in airport terminals) instead of sidewalks to get around my neighborhood. I live is a small town (population about 500), so it would encourage people to drive less to get to destinations that are close to their homes."
3068,8,141,['drive'],"My neighborhood added an above ground train similar to the ""L"" in Chicago.  It runs along the highways bringing people downtown from the suburbs.  It does a few loops downtown and runs near the major companies to get people to work.  It is much cheaper and more convenient than driving downtown and parking."
3069,8,141,['drive'],"My neighborhood filled with uber drives. However, there is no cost assoicated with the transit it is all provided by the town. It would be like new york city (think of cabs), however nice black cars everywhere and someone can hop in to any one they want free of charge. Baisically be like public transit with uber and they will take you wherever you want."
3070,8,141,['drive'],My neighborhood needs a car share system between individuals. It would be similar to Uber but you would be able to drive someone else's car for a monthly fee.
3071,8,141,['drive'],"My neighborhood/city/state is ultra conservative- so having bike lanes would be an improvement. Even though this city I live in (Huntsville, AL) has more Ph.D's per capita we are still woefully behind. Since it's such a tech town with so many engineers though...it would have to be something very advanced to get these engineers on board. Like some sort of train driven by magnetic rails."
3072,8,141,['drive'],Open a government-funded shop that lets people buy bikes at a discount. This way more people will have an incentive to ride bikes instead of driving around.
3073,8,141,['drive'],"Our small city is fairly bike/walker friendly, but I think a bike rental kiosk or a bike trading program would be so helpful. I don't own a bike, but I'd like for it to be easier and quicker to get around without driving."
3074,8,141,['drive'],"People could ride bicycles to work, it would help as it would be good exercise. It could also be fun to do something different, as most others drives cars or trucks. However it could only for for close workplaces, as a lot of work is further then in bicycling distance."
3075,8,141,['drive'],Pneumatic tubes - just like at the drive through at the bank
3076,8,141,['drive'],"Public transportation should be free a few times per month -- maybe one weekend day or holiday, and one working day.  This will cause less people to drive and improve the environment, and bring in more transportation money to the city.  Also, it would urge people to tell their elected officials to improve public transportation so that they can take advantage of it more."
3077,8,141,['drive'],"Ride scooters to a local bus stop that. Houses scooters on the bus, up to 10 miles from house, to work in the inner city, (25 miles from bus stop) it would save gas and pollution, instead of 25 people driving take a bus. Scooters get better Mpg and it's safer to stay on a bus on a highway than a scooter."
3078,8,141,['drive'],"roads that are like people movers so that you dont really have to drive they just move the car for you, save gas and no accidents"

3080,8,141,['drive'],Self driving bicycles powered by solar power!
3081,8,141,['drive'],self driving car pods that will pick you up and dro you off then move on somewhere else
3082,8,141,['drive'],"Self driving cars that could detect traffic/other cars and could navigate to a specific location would be great in this town, especially at night to avoid accidents due to intoxicated driving of college students. The cars could be rented from the town and ordered similarly to taxi cabs, and could drive students home from the bars for a fee without relying on very tired or intoxicated friends to do so."
3083,8,141,['drive'],"Self driving cars that you can schedule to arrive with an app on your smartphone. It will pick you up and take you anywhere, and it's all automated. No dealing with drivers or people. It runs efficiently and clean with electric vehicles."
3084,8,141,['drive'],"Self driving planes. The reason that flying cars never took off was because the high crash risk, now with autonomous cars around the corner planes will be next."
3085,8,141,['drive'],self driving pod cars you can hail easily
3086,8,141,['drive'],Self driving rental trucks.  They come to you instead of having to drive it all the way across town to where you live. You load  then unload your stuff then it drives itself back to the rental place.
3087,8,141,['drive'],Self driving scooters/motorcycles that come to your door step and drive themselves (you) to your destination.
3088,8,141,['drive'],shared self driving cars that come to your door at the push of a button
3089,8,141,['drive'],"Taxi-style self-driving cars which can be summoned via app and hired for longer journeys, or which would at least serve rural areas. Cars would probably have to be stationed at depots on the outskirts of town, activating and driving off when pinged."
3090,8,141,['drive'],Taxis that drive themselves
3091,8,141,['drive'],"The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
3092,8,141,['drive'],"The man used his old, used car for transportation every day to drive to work and back to his house."
3093,8,141,['drive'],The neighborhood needs a rail system that runs adjacent to the highway. This would go from major city to major city with the same stops as for those that drive.
3094,8,141,['drive'],"The transportation system in my neighborhood consists of each person driving their own cars. Occasionally, people will carpool, but there is no public transportation and walking is not feasable."
3095,8,141,['drive'],The transportation system would be a combination of roads with cars and a railroad track. All of the cars would be connected and be able to drive themselves. Cars would all be on tracks and controlled by the car itself. This would lower accidents and allow for better traffic. Cars would be able to accelerate much faster as there is no driver intervention and you don't have to wait for other cars to accelerate or worry about where other cars are going.
3096,8,141,['drive'],"The transportation would be efficient; it would be green and rely on newer energies that are not dependent upon fossil fuels. It also would be future-proof, such that it would reduce and combat the issues of traffic jams and collisions. We still would have private and public transportation, allowing people to make the choice of which is better for their needs. There also would be strict requirements for those who choose to drive; thus reducing the amount of likely collisions. It would be affordable and allow society to continue to grow and prosper."
3097,8,141,['drive'],There could be a really good motorcycle driver that would drive fast and come pick you up. He would know back roads and side allys very well. He could weve in and out of traffic and get you somewhere really fast.
3098,8,141,['drive'],There will be a set of water slides that link the houses in my gated community.  They will have propelled sections that you control with a lever attached to your slide so you can visit neighbors without driving.  They will be enclosed for bad weather.
3099,8,141,['drive'],think it will be self driving cars aka taxis coming soon. really when apple says they are working on a self driving car
3100,8,141,['drive'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
3101,8,141,['drive'],"Transportation is mostly done by cars nowadays, but why don't we use rocket powered shoes instead? Flying with footwear is not only cool, it would be much faster than driving."
3102,8,141,['drive'],Transportation that would allow people to rent out electric self driving cars. This would let people have cars pick them up at whatever location they want and have the car autonomously drive to their destination. Similar to a fleet of self driving electric taxis. This would greatly reduce the cost of transportation in my opinion because people would not have to buy cars but could rather rent or lease them.
3103,8,141,['drive'],vans that drive the same routes all the time that charge a small fee
3104,8,141,['drive'],We all have very light buggies made out of balsa wood.  There would be a sail equipped on all the buggies. Wind driven buggies.
3105,8,141,['drive'],"We all transport by cafe-mobiles. Basically it is a portable cafe. Starbucks for example, sents out mobiles that can house two customers and a barista. It is a self driving mobile, so the barista can only worry about serving his customers as they are being driven to work."
3106,8,141,['drive'],we can have a carpooling service where people drive together for free. gas is paid for by every 10th person.
3107,8,141,['drive'],We could have hover board paths that would allow people to go short distances without driving all the time. A path to the side of the road strictly for hoverboards or other electric devices used to get around.
3108,8,141,['drive'],When I imagine future transportation in my neighborhood I visualize the vehicles of today with more advanced technology. I image that the vehicles will be able to drive themselves and all that is needed is for a person to input their destination and sit back. I think that the interior of the vehicles will be the biggest changes because these vehicles will allow people to sit back and relax. I think that the interior will be comfortable seats and have TVs to pass the time. Overall I imagine future transportation being someone similar to today but with less demand on people.
3109,8,141,['drive'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
3110,8,141,['drive'],Combining food delivery services with taxi driving to maximize efficiency.
3111,8,141,['drive'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
3112,8,141,['drive'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
3113,8,141,['drive'],"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."
3114,9,140,['area'],"A Bus system, within the metro area that was funded by a tax on gas purchased by individual commuters. In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."
3115,9,140,['area'],"A central hub for a ridesharing service that provides cars for small groups to take to neighboring towns. I live in a rural area, a few minutes from a very small village. The nearest SMALL city is about 30 minutes away, and the nearest decent sized city is almost an hour away. A ridesharing service would make accessing these places much easier, and if the company provided the car (for a fee, of course), those without vehicles could be serviced."
3116,9,140,['area'],A going to town app. In a rural area like where I live sometimes you avoid going to town because you don't have a ride or you just don't feel you can justify driving all that way just to run a quick errand. Enter an app that connects you to people along your travel rout who also need to go into town. You could flag yourself as offering a ride or needing a ride.
3117,9,140,['area'],"A group carpooling smartphone app that allows people in apartment complexes or housing areas to visualize a profile of others in the area that are traveling to a nearby destination. Participants can communicate over the app, and background check and everything is done before being certified to use the service. People can post looking for ride notes, or say that they are traveling to a specific area and looking for passengers to ride in order to split costs."
3118,9,140,['area'],A high speed train/subway that links all the cities in the Detroit metro area.
3119,9,140,['area'],"A large network of rails traveling from downtown to every other part part of the surrounding area featuring energy efficient, sleek that arrive every ten to twenty minutes at each station"
3120,9,140,['area'],"a large open vehicle that moves slowly on wheels around the downtown area, carries about 25 people"
3121,9,140,['area'],"A more thorough bus system with buses running more frequently and covering a wider area.  Other modes would not be feasible for this area.



An Uber-type crowd-sourced system for carpooling."
3122,9,140,['area'],"A motorized scooter ""stop.""  Basically a few very popular areas you can pick up a scooter from an agent.  Credit is the only thing that's acceptable, as they need to have something on file in case you ride off with the scooter.  These locations where you can both rent, and return scooters will only be in very popular areas (Such as the mall, a large amount of business buildings, and the like.)  Make it relatively affordable, and have people be able to write it off as an expense."
3123,9,140,['area'],"A moving sidewalk - like the ones you would see in an airport to help expedite movement between terminals.  Around my area there are a lot of close shops, so people could walk, but getting loads of bags home would be difficult.  Having mechanical walkways would enable people to do their shopping but reduce their need to use cars, and at the same time set all their bags down so they don't have to figure out how to lug them home, especially if they've purchased something heavy.  It could also allow people to get where they need to go faster, if they continue to walk along the moving sidewalk.  They could sit alongside regular sidewalks, so people who still wanted to go out for a walk and get some fresh air could do so.  The mechanical/moving sidewalks would be made out of metal, look like a flat escalator, have hand railings, and each side of the road would have a sidewalk that goes the same way as traffic."
3124,9,140,['area'],A moving sidewalk could be useful in some areas of my neighbourhood.
3125,9,140,['area'],A new railway system! We don't have any trains or railways anywhere near the area I live in.
3126,9,140,['area'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
3127,9,140,['area'],"A new type of transportation in my area would be like a double decker bus, but more levels. There would be different areas for kids, a lounge area, an elevator that would take you do the different levels. You would pay a monthly fee and it would have a path where it would make stops. Not just a mode of transporation, but a fun transportation where you can relax and interact with people at the same time."
3128,9,140,['area'],A online map real time of the buses and trains the area. Buses and trains aren't usually on time and having real on time traffic will show if its a bad bad to drive.
3129,9,140,['area'],"A roaming private car that you can pay by the mile or carpool. Basically, the car would go up and down the street or area and put trips together (like going to the grocery store or the same shopping center) and split the costs, so it can be as affordable as a bus but more private."
3130,9,140,['area'],A service where you can easily pick up a ride to ublic transportation. many people live in areas where public transportation is just slighlty out of reach. this would allow people to get there in an easy an inexpensive manner.
3131,9,140,['area'],"A smartphone app similar to uber but for carpooling. Once it hits a predetermined amount of users needing a ride in a concentrated area, the app suggests grouping the users together and designates possible drivers to pick them up if users agree."
3132,9,140,['area'],"A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
3133,9,140,['area'],"a system of bikes that one can rent for free. Bike racks are located every few miles. People can use a key to scan and take out a bike, and return it at any of the racks in the area."
3134,9,140,['area'],"A system of neighborhood drivers who form a cooperative and use their own vehicles to provide transportation services. We live in a community of 1875 people in a rural area, it may not be practical, but it is doable."
3135,9,140,['area'],A system with bike racks so people can rent bikes and ride around would be nice. There can be multiple areas to be rented from.
3136,9,140,['area'],A transportation Idea I have is to have networked building walkways. Think of it like your average street crossing but instead of connecting streets it connects neighboring buildings instead. There would be no access to private buildings but pedestrians would be able to walk enclosed walkways running through special areas in the building to get to the next. I think this idea is very practical in heavy urban areas and would be a refreshing change from the average commute.
3137,9,140,['area'],"A trolley system would be a great source of transportation, using small trolleys instead of buses.  Another Idea would be a mini bus system that primarily transported people to key areas like the train station or the airport.  A shuttle system."
3138,9,140,['area'],"A vehicle which does not have contact with the earth. That means the vehicle repels with the earth, that is a force against the gravity. The repulsion is constantly managed a new technology so that the vehicle have a permanent distance from the earth. Pressure controllers can be used to create pressure variation in the air and the vehicle moves to the lower pressure area with the air."
3139,9,140,['area'],"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."
3140,9,140,['area'],Adding a metro to our area would be great. It would provide a quicker way to get around as opposed to the buses that are frequently full. It could run from the residential areas to the university.
3141,9,140,['area'],"Along any road, there can be a big truck that bicyclists, skateboarders, roller bladers, etc can hold on to to they can get a break and a boost in speed.  Whenever they need to get off, they just let go and get to their destination under their own power. There can be loading areas where the truck slows down to let people on. There can be signs and road markings to signify this."
3142,9,140,['area'],"An above-ground train system. We scrapped a trolley system, and some areas can't support a subway. Above-ground might be useful for us."
3143,9,140,['area'],An underground rail system would be great. That way you could get around without having to get stuck in traffic.  There are so many cars in this area that we are known for our traffic.
3144,9,140,['area'],"Automated taxi service. Would have several dispatch stations in key areas of city. Person could call for a ride from an app on their phone and it would send a car to them. The software could calculate rate for the trip and make you pay before as a confirmation before sending a car out. Car could then drive customer to said destination.  Self driveable cars that could provide a much better service than the often RUDE cab drivers could provide. Plus, I trust a robot way more than some of these morons driving!"
3145,9,140,['area'],"Companies should use some of their advertising budget to provide rides to certain places.  This would double as advertising for that company, so they would not lose out on money and we could get unique transportation for several untapped routes, especially if it is discovered that a lot of people are traveling outside of their usual living area, like for a special event.  The companies could create specialized buses so that several people can ride, and can put their logo on the outside of the bus and could name the transportation something catchy using the company name so that word-of-mouth provides extra advertising."
3146,9,140,['area'],"Drones.  They are on the cutting edge of technology.  Amazon is going to implement them.  I think sending drones to go pick up your dry cleaning or your groceries would be very attractive to a great number of people.  It will be the future of transportation of goods.  You can pilot your own drone, or you can have a drone for each store.  You rent one from the dry cleaners, the grocery store, etc.  They are pre-programmed to travel their flight path and the people at the store load 'em up and send them back home to you.  This is perfect especially in cold weather or snowy areas."
3147,9,140,['area'],"Electric bicycles that work only within a specified area. Like shopping carts that lock wheels when taken too far away from the store, these bikes would lock up when taken outside the area. Anyone can use these bikes within this area."
3148,9,140,['area'],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
3149,9,140,['area'],"Get some large vans and people who are going to the same general area to work can all ride together.  They take turns driving.  It'll be like kids' school buses but for adults.  It'll save money and help bond co-workers together.  There will be enough room for a lot of people so the chances of an incident are slim.  It'll also help when it's bad weather because some people are afraid to drive in it and this would ease some of that stress.  Plus, they could all share in the maintenance and gas for the bus/car so that could save them a lot of money."
3150,9,140,['area'],"Handicapped taxi. Public transportation is awful in my area, so if you are in a wheelchair then you need an expensive handicapped van just to be able to get around. Some taxi wheelchair van options would be great for people who can't afford a $30,000 wheelchair van and might otherwise have a hard time getting around."
3151,9,140,['area'],"Have a business where drivers rent cars, for hours and not days. The cars can be electric cars. Make them the cheapest cars possible. Make it for around the metro area only - and have the credit card swiper built into the car itself. In other words If you rent three hours with the car, it goes dead until you pay for more time. If someone takes it out of the pre-defined boundaries  of the city the car goes dead. You would have these little rental kiosks set up all over the city."
3152,9,140,['area'],Helicopter based taxi that can be taken anywhere.  The roof tops will now be loading and unloading areas and it will free up car congestion.
3153,9,140,['area'],horse drawn carriage I think it would be cool to do this again in our main downtown area where are the restaurants are. Would be nice.
3154,9,140,['area'],Horse drawn carriage would rock here in this southwestern mountain town. People would really love it and it would be more reasonable for my area than just your average bus or taxi.
3155,9,140,['area'],"How about color coded cars that only service a particular area for a flat rate. As the car takes a passenger to desired location within that particular area, if another person flags that same colored car, that person can hop in and share the ride. After all, the drop off points will be in the same general area and the rate is flat."
3156,9,140,['area'],"I don't anticipate the transportation system changing too much in my area no matter the time frame. I think the car will rule for the next several decades, but I would like the cars to change. They need not be so huge, and would be powered by plug-in type electrical engines. Each home would have a solar array and this would power your home, and your car. A back-up natural gas power plant would help out if it's cloudy for weeks. Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
3157,9,140,['area'],I feel the best is a transportation tunnel.  It should run around 150 miles per hour and provide food accommodations as well as sleeping areas!
3158,9,140,['area'],"I imagine a train line that rings the entire city, with interstitial lines to service the downtown areas."
3159,9,140,['area'],"I live in a fairly small town that has a decent amount of people but isn't very large in area. Solar powered railcars could be a viable option for this area. They would only have to travel short distances at once, and it could easily be utilized by everybody in town by having just a few stops. Think about the railcars in San Francisco and other major cities being completely solar powered. The electricity saving would be huge."
3160,9,140,['area'],"I live in a pretty population dense area where most things people need (like a hospital, a big job center, homes, grocery store) are pretty close to each other.  I think this set up begs for a monorail.  It would be elevated so wouldn't interfere with current traffic too much, but would provide a nice transportation system for people to take for short trips."
3161,9,140,['area'],"I live in a rural area and a lot of people have horses- so an uber or lyft but actually with horses! If you are a nw rider, you can be on a horse on a lead rope, and if you have experience, you can just rent the horse!"
3162,9,140,['area'],"I live in a rural area so horseback travel, hay wagon travel and buckboard travel may well be decent substitutes for cars and buses presently being used."
3163,9,140,['area'],"I live in a rural area, it's pretty hilly but it runs along the length of a valley. It would be really nice to have a walking/bike path that connects the residential neighborhood to the commercial district without having the bike/walk on the road. Although it's generally slow traffic, walking on the road is never exactly safe. Especially in the winter. To be able to network together the few towns in the valley too would be very nice."
3164,9,140,['area'],I live in a rural community about 1 hour from a city. I would like to see this area build a light rail commuter line that could link these isolated communities and boost the economy. Many people out here do not even have cars.
3165,9,140,['area'],"I live in a very rural area that doesn't get bus service because of low population. My idea would be a bus service that runs on the same premise as a taxi service... when someone in the area would need a ride, the bus would alter its route to pick up a passenger. That way, the remote area could be serviced by mass transit, yet wouldn't have to waste fuel or money driving to the remote area all of the time. These requests could be put in via phone, web portal, or e-mail."
3166,9,140,['area'],I live in an area where horses are abundant. It would be a trip if everyone started using their horse instead of a car or motorcycle.
3167,9,140,['area'],"I live in an area where there are a lot of senior citizens so driving can sometimes be scary, and I think this city would greatly benefit from public transportation. However, I think something that would benefit the environment would be the most helpful, so I think pushcarts would be a lot of fun, or even horse drawn carriages. Not only would these be better for the environment, but I think the older people would appreciate the old-fashioned nature of such public transport systems."
3168,9,140,['area'],"I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
3169,9,140,['area'],I think a spiral starting from the center of the city going out to the edges of the city.  The spiral should be able to get all the areas if it's only 2-3 blocks wide.  It would have a dedicated lane so traffic wouldn't affect the bus and vice versa.  There would be a way to quickly have people enter and exit the bus and this would keep it on time.  Of course the bus is electric powered.
3170,9,140,['area'],I think adding a rail system in my city would be a great idea. The only public transportation we have is buses and there are a lot of areas they don't even run to. So I think a rail system would do wonders in getting a lot of other people where they were going.
3171,9,140,['area'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
3172,9,140,['area'],I think my neighborhood would benefit from one of those pedal bike bars for the downtown area. There is a lot of history and what better way to enjoy it than while sipping a nice drink and getting some exercise
3173,9,140,['area'],I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.
3174,9,140,['area'],"I think that one cool idea is to have personal transportation that allows you to connect with other people in your area so you can rideshare and also carpool or get a ride when needed. Instead of using like Craigslist to ask for rideshare or ask if people are willing to pick  them up, you use an app. People can sign into this app and then say which direction they are going. Along the way you can request that person pick you up to get you from A to B...kind of like hitchhiking through a mobile app."
3175,9,140,['area'],"I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
3176,9,140,['area'],"I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
3177,9,140,['area'],I think there should be bikes that you can easily rent. You can get them in the major shopping areas and drive them around town to get excercise as well as helping to use less gasoline.
3178,9,140,['area'],"I think we should focus on making it easier for people to bike around the area. We need to widen sidewalks and/or have separate paths just for pedestrians and bikers. Oftentimes, the bike lanes are narrow or end abruptly."
3179,9,140,['area'],"I want an elevated railway that preserves nature, resists going down during snow and bad weather, and reaches all areas of my city. It would be public transportation and have low-cost monthly passes. It would also run on renewable, clean energy."
3180,9,140,['area'],"I wish we had separate bicycle highways that were enclosed spaces, both heated and cooled for summer/winter. It would be a cheaper mode of transportation. There would be protection to prevent car vs bicycle accident, a major problem in our area. It would also be healthier and exercise for the day during a commute. I picture it being a rounded space that is clear so you can see your surroundings outside."
3181,9,140,['area'],"I would like a city trolley. The trolley would travel around the city several times a day, taking and picking up residents from the major shopping areas. The trolley stops should be no more than two blocks from any neighborhood."
3182,9,140,['area'],I would like a non-gas mode of transportation to be created for our area such as a horse drawn carriage where the horses are treated really well but they also go fast and get us where we need to go.
3183,9,140,['area'],"I would like an interchangeable form of light rail, in which the train would have several compartments that would be destined for multiple locations. That way you just get on the train, and the train goes to an interchange. At the interchange the compartments are separated (I imagine they are held together by magnets) and grouped together by location. Once all the compartments that are going to the same area are together, the train leaves. It would work like changing trains, except you wouldn't have to go outside."
3184,9,140,['area'],I would like it if the area I lived in used a bike sharing system like I have seen in some other major cities like Portland and Minneapolis.
3185,9,140,['area'],"I would like to see a bicycle highway.  It would go the length of regular highways, but be for bikes and pedestrians.  It should be wide enough for fast moving road cyclist, it should have passing lanes, and little road crossings.  There should be frequent on and off ramps.  There should also be many large parking areas.  Ideally it would even lead to public transportation areas with ample bike parking."
3186,9,140,['area'],I would like to see a cable car that runs across the city.  It would take people across the busy streets.  It would be convenient for office workers. It would cut down on traffic in the downtown area.
3187,9,140,['area'],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
3188,9,140,['area'],"I would like to see public transportation on buses expanded in my area, with a dedicated area for bicycles to also be transported on the buses.  This would help a lot with traffic, and still allow people to get to their destinations quickly."
3189,9,140,['area'],"I would love it if the city made walking and riding a bike more user friendly. There are no areas that are safe for pedestrians or bikers. If there were a bike lane, more people could move independently and get to where they are going. Commuters using more than one mode of transportation would be able to get to their destinations more quickly and with greater safety."
3190,9,140,['area'],"I would love to see a social network for people that work for a certain business. This social network would allow you to find rides from other employees that live in your area. Every business would have an account at this website, and employees who want to pick up other employees can volunteer. Maybe a $5 fee per person each week to account for gas money, but it could be like it would tell you who lives within 10 miles from you that works where you do, and you can ride share or carpool with them. It would be almost like a social network where you can talk to other employees you don't know and then you can ride together or take turns driving."
3191,9,140,['area'],"I would really like to see separate lanes for scooters in my area.  A lot more people are commuting this way, and it would be good if it was a safer way to drive."
3192,9,140,['area'],"I'd like to see shuttle trams in my area. It's a small section based urban area that has about four different areas all residents will have to visit at some point in time. If we had a shuttle system that specifically transported people from a central point to the four primary destinations it would incredibly reduce the use of fossil fuels, traffic, and accidents in the area."
3193,9,140,['area'],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
3194,9,140,['area'],I'd like to see the combination of a food truck and a taxi. This way you could grab a fresh made bite to eat while on your way to the destination. There would be a seating area in the front and a small kitchen with a service window in the back. This bus could serve hot and cold sandwiches and maybe drinkable soup in cups with lids to prevent spills. Now all you have to do is hail a cab. Forget finding something to eat then looking for the cab. The food can be prepared for you onboard.
3195,9,140,['area'],I'd like to see the railroad tracks by our house be repurposed as a walking and biking route for the neighborhood.  It would be really sweet if they could use that and carry the corridor all the way to the nearest town and shopping area.
3196,9,140,['area'],"I'd love to see a crowdsourced method of alternate transportation in my city, where people could request rides from others who happen to be in the area and going the direction you need to with a minimal cost. There are so many people who have cars and it would be a great option for people who don't have reliable access to one. It could use cell phone apps and perhaps even have a traditional component using telephone for people who are less technologically inclined. The biggest challenge would be safety/security, and I'm honestly not sure how to overcome that aspect. There could be specific stops, almost like bus stops, where people could gather and wait for rides, or schedule rides to pick them up at certain times."
3197,9,140,['area'],"I'd really like to see a little pod that you could get into.  It has a minor sedative so you can relax on your commute.  A bus or something of the sort would come by and pick up pods which are locked and only you can open.  You hang a sign or type in your wanted destination, and a bus that goes roughly to the area scoops you up.  



Upon getting to your destination, the bus drops you off at a stop, and the sedative wears off with an alarm to wake you up."
3198,9,140,['area'],"Idea 1 . Semi conductor can be design in such a way that it can be RE-USED.

Idea 2 . Renewable energy - the cost of the solar cells has been going down a lot, the labor to install them hasn't, and that's an area where innovation can help."
3199,9,140,['area'],Im from Seattle and it is mostly built over the top of the old city that burned down. I would think that they'd be able to build subways here at least through the downtown area where they have underground tours of the city.
3200,9,140,['area'],In dense urban areas have a series of high tension wires between buildings. Have a  mechanized seat something like a zipline  that people would ride on. This would need a seatbelt or maybe an enclosed capsule for safety but the idea is making the seat as compact as possible .
3201,9,140,['area'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
3202,9,140,['area'],"In the downtown area, stations to rent bicycles or even mopeds. Maybe you could have a really cheap membership and present your card at the check out station. Then you would return it at another check out station. It would cut down on how much people use cars. The key would be having enough stations to actually get the bike or moped to make the idea viable."
3203,9,140,['area'],"In the interest of reducing traffic and accidents, a new series of self-driving only roads and lanes are opened.  On these roads, ONLY self driving cars are authorized to drive, and on them there are no speed limits (not that the self-driving cars would be going that much faster than normal). Unfettered by the chaos of common roads and the limitations of human judgement, these exclusively self-driving vehicle areas allow the navigational AIs to coordinate for an optimally fast and efficient journey."
3204,9,140,['area'],"It is not innovative in terms of the whole world, but would be very innovative in my community - bike shares. The area where I live is suburban, so difficult to get enough riders for frequent mass transit. And it's too spread out for just walking. Bike share stands, where subscribers had a code to access bikes from a bike locker, would allow people to commute from place to place (even just to nearby main bus routes) with relative ease."
3205,9,140,['area'],"It would be a very good idea to come up with some kind of effective carpooling system in my area. I live in a rural place, but there could be a central park-and-ride lot built along the major thoroughfare to make carpooling simpler. Perhaps an app could be developed to run the carpooling system so that everyone is on the same page."
3206,9,140,['area'],It would be cool it we had a monorail type system throughout the neighborhood that does a simple circle and takes kids or adults from the neighboorhood into the town/school area.
3207,9,140,['area'],"It would be hard to have a viable system in my neighborhood, because this area is so scattered. I think the best idea would be a bikeshare; inexpensive access to bikes would be a great idea! The bigger issue would be making our area bike-friendly. That's the part the requires creativity. We could add extra lanes and then add over/underpasses at intersections to make bikes not just inexpensive, but even more time-effective than driving."
3208,9,140,['area'],"It would be small individual electric golf cart-like cars that run along the edge of the sidewalks every couple of minutes that people can hop into to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, post office, etc.  they operate from out of a common neighborhood ""hub"" so each system covers a small area.  People can just call one from an app on their smart phone, they are charged a small fee, then after the trip, the cart remains in one area until it is called again or it returns to the hub to be charged."
3209,9,140,['area'],It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.
3210,9,140,['area'],"Larger Vehicles for apps like Uber that set up car pool for large amounts of people that are going to the same area. For example in Austin, Texas many people enjoy 6th straight but struggle to find parking. If apps like uber could set up their own busses or larger vehicles for transportation to places like 6th street or concerts/ sports arenas it would be much more efficient than a bus that makes regular stops."
3211,9,140,['area'],Mini bus services around the neighborhood covering the residential area so that single rides can be reduced
3212,9,140,['area'],Monorail type cart that takes you to high populated areas/
3213,9,140,['area'],Monorails really can be implemented between high occupancy areas..  There can be direct routes to places such as grocery stores or department stores that people frequent a lot.  This will also boost business and sales if people can access these places quicker.
3214,9,140,['area'],"Moving platforms that function like traincars and moving sidewalks put together. They would go above roads, have railings on each side and be like busses with bus stops. You could buy a thing like a bus pass that allows you x number of rides, so that you don't have to have cash on your person to be able to get on it. It would run from neighborhoods to main city areas and only be running when people call for it/use it to save money on electricity/gas/whatever"
3215,9,140,['area'],"My idea for public transportation would include an underground rail system powered by magnets. Because of the varied climate as well as prevalence natural disasters in my area, having the system underground seems like the best idea. The train would stop a lot more often than normal trains; At the end of every street at least. It would have a separate exit system in order to not lose quite as much time loading and unloading passengers."
3216,9,140,['area'],My idea is to build an app for uber drivers that show all the short cuts to a location. Even if they have to drive through residential areas. The app will calculate the shortest distance and time depending on traffic.
3217,9,140,['area'],My idea is to use special parking lots for energy efficient vehicles in order to give incentive to the use of cleaner energy. These parking lots could be in the more crowded city areas and you'd need a special pass or something after having your vehicle cleared.
3218,9,140,['area'],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
3219,9,140,['area'],"Off the ground magnetic rails have high speed autonomous trains that anyone can use, and it gets you to areas much faster than can now be done."
3220,9,140,['area'],"One thing I would love to see in my local area is rent able electric scooters. They would be good for the environment, easy to maintain, and reduce traffic in terms of larger vehicles on the road."
3221,9,140,['area'],"Our new transportation system would involve golf carts.  Several roads would be designated as golf-cart-only areas and include parking.  New paths could be created because they take up less space than normal roads and even designated lanes on existing roads could be defined to use existing infrastructure.  The environment would be healthier with less pollutants, crowding would be less due to smaller size vehicles, and it would even encourage healthier lifestyles out in the air and sunshine."
3222,9,140,['area'],Perhaps a system where you can rent out bicycles or motorbikes to get to where you need to go. You could hold a lot of them in one area and make it easy to check out the bike and then return it later. It would help getting around for people who can't afford a car service to take them around the city but also for people who prefer to be health conscious and also want to save money by biking around the city.
3223,9,140,['area'],Picture a vehicle of transport that almost resembles a giant scooter. But the thing is that more than a few people can ride it at a time and it can be programmed to go to the destination that you need. There is also the option of seatbelts or straps that can prevent the riders from falling out or off. In the back of the scooter object would be a large area where personal baggage and things can be kept and it automatically locks once enough passengers are aboard. This area is kept locked by the operator of the scooter ride. On each side of the edges of the scooter ride are places for phones and other devices to be plugged in. The scooter ride would be plugged in to keep it charged up and there would be solar panels on the back to make sure that the ride can be energized and charged for a moment's notice.
3224,9,140,['area'],"Pollution is becoming a real problem in my area. The local government should provide tax incentives for people who adopt clean energy vehicles. The high upfront cost of these vehicles make the cost prohibitive to many, but by creating tax incentives, the local government would be able to offset some of that cost."
3225,9,140,['area'],"Public, foot-based transportation. Something like the automatic walkways in airports, but for long stretches of large cities, particularly between common high-traffic areas. It would probably be best if the walkways were raised, to avoid conflict with other ground traffic. It must also include access for the disabled, be easy enough for even tech-fearful users, and extremely safe (with monitored auto-shutoff where applicable)."
3226,9,140,['area'],"Railway tunnels off of the highways (outdoor subways) to provide a fast paced mode of transportation on busy streets that work with a system like uber that will have drivers readily available at each location. More for suburban areas, not large city areas that have subway/rail systems."
3227,9,140,['area'],Roller coasters to get from one critical area to another critical area.
3228,9,140,['area'],"Scooter sharing, where they are parked in small areas and like the shared cars. Except scooters for single people."
3229,9,140,['area'],"Scooters or bikes for rent put in areas that are too far to walk but for people who can't afford a car, uber, or taxi. You could rent them for a day and return them to the area that evening or keep them for another day's charge like a Redbox sort of system."
3230,9,140,['area'],Skyline car- Have pods that move above the buildings and are connected to main areas of interest. People can pay a toll to use them and be transported around the city
3231,9,140,['area'],Some type of underground or above-ground monorail system to help with the massive traffic problem in my area. With stations in key locations that are unobtrusive to the overall community.
3232,9,140,['area'],"Taken from the idea of bike rentals, there should also be motorized scooters available for rental, where you can rent any motorized scooter from a ""station"" and return it to another ""station"" around your area when you are done."
3233,9,140,['area'],"Tampa, FL is one of the largest metro areas in the country without any sort of rail system, and traffic is bad. I would love to see a commuter rail system in our town, with a downtown hub and then lines extending north to the Wesley Chapel/Lutz area, out to Brandon, and then another line out to the Westshore/Airport area."
3234,9,140,['area'],"Taxi-style self-driving cars which can be summoned via app and hired for longer journeys, or which would at least serve rural areas. Cars would probably have to be stationed at depots on the outskirts of town, activating and driving off when pinged."
3235,9,140,['area'],"The area is very car-dependent, but a train or monorail going down the middle or above the main highways would be a great way to travel down the expressways and parkways without having to depend on a car."
3236,9,140,['area'],The last new type of teleportation that I can think of would be tubes that connected to certain places and people could get in them to be pushed through to the other end of the tube to another area. They would be large and everywhere so it would only take up space in the air and there would be lots of places to go to.
3237,9,140,['area'],There are a lot of fairly narrow paths in between buildings in my area. It would be good if they could be paved smoother to be used by bicyclists. It would make their travel more efficient and would also increase their safety as they wouldn't have to spend as much time on roads meant for cars.
3238,9,140,['area'],"There are many parts of my area that aren't accessible by foot or bicycle; in order to get from one section of town to another, you have to take a highway, where only motorized vehicles area allowed. This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
3239,9,140,['area'],There is no bus system so my idea is for a bus system in my area.  I live in a suburbs of a small town and there is no bus out here.  It would be nice to have one.  Sometimes I don't have access to a car and maybe this bus could help me get to the store or church.  I would also like the bus system to be able to take me to the small town to go shopping and stuff.
3240,9,140,['area'],"There should be a completely separate bike lane that runs throughout the city, and is plowed even during the winter.  Currently the biking situation isn't too bad, but there are areas where it is hard to feel safe with cars passing by too closely.  During the winter, it is impossible to bike due to snow in the bike lanes"
3241,9,140,['area'],"There should be paid service for a bus route to pick up people who live right outside a city. I will use my self as an example for my idea. I live about 20 miles for a major city . If I didn't have a automobile I would not be able to get anywhere important. Now the nearest cilty has a bus route only for those in the city. But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area. The school bus service already does this , I don't know why the city could come up with a plan to offer public transportation for adults living in rural areas. It's just very stupid that this is not a thing in Houston ."
3242,9,140,['area'],This area could really use a super speed train that goes much faster than traffic. It could travel above the road system and would save tons of time for many people.
3243,9,140,['area'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
3244,9,140,['area'],"This might be only useful for some places, but it's better than none.  I think there should be a moving walkway for the most common areas of a town or city.  This way foot traffic can be consistent and the flow high.  Since it's fairly low speed there shouldn't be any injury issues and transferring is as easy as getting off the one walkway and on to another."
3245,9,140,['area'],"To help cover a lot of area of a city, the could be a central hub where all the trains, busses, etc start.  Then from that one spot, all the route lines shoot out, like a star.  That way all the people can be at one spot and make it to where they want to go easily since there are no transfers or any other confusing things."
3246,9,140,['area'],"Uber is not currently available in my area, because it is not seen as a large enough ""metro"" area. I believe that if several of the small communities pooled together, there would be enough available and willing drivers to start a less urban and more suburban/rural version of a paid ridesharing service. Since the communities would be pooled, there would likely be drivers from many different areas of the community, so a larger geographic area could be served."
3247,9,140,['area'],uber lyft or any taxi cabs we are a rural area very large and towns near or past 30 min away from eachother. having a taxi service would be very appreciative and would also bring more jobs locally throughout the whole southern part of this state really/
3248,9,140,['area'],"Ultimate monkey bars.  People are too fat in my area, forcing them to travel via monkey bars across the neighborhood should help not only with emission decrease, but weight decrease as well!  There will just be an overhead system running the lengths of the sidewalks at 7 foot high so no one gets hurt if they fall."
3249,9,140,['area'],"Using autonomous cars/vehicles as taxis that you can rent and have escort you anywhere you would like to go in your area. Cars will be equipped with GPS so customers can log where their destinations, etc."
3250,9,140,['area'],"We will have cars that can lift off the ground and ""fly"" with a air propel system. This would be fast enough for them to travel in that city area without hitting any others."
3251,9,140,['area'],"What we need is a better public transportation system that services the East end of the city.  Perhaps a bullet shuttle that will pick up in certain areas of the East End, and shuttle t predetermined locations within the city such as the downtown area, in addition to other areas."
3252,9,140,['area'],"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."
3253,9,140,['area'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
3254,10,137,['traffic'],"A both walking and bike lane that provides safety from traffic, is well lit, and connects key locations around the neighborhood."
3255,10,137,['traffic'],"A bus that has a design similar to a hydrofoil boat. The bus would run on special tracks that would be parallel to each other on opposite sides of a street. This passenger compartment would be on top, with the ""foils"" connecting to the two tracks. There would be open space underneath the passenger compartment where the road is. This way, the bus could move unimpeded by traffic, while also not disrupting traffic itself. Also, passengers would not even see the traffic below them, making the ride smooth, comfortable, and consistent."
3256,10,137,['traffic'],A disaster movie about a blimp that gets a slow leak.  Most of the movie will take place in the cockpit.  It will be conversational based between the pilots and air traffic control.
3257,10,137,['traffic'],a flying car to dodge traffic
3258,10,137,['traffic'],A flying car would be a good innovation. We would free up the roads making less traffic jams and it'd give people new experiences.
3259,10,137,['traffic'],"A form of transportation similar to an airlift, only the seats are at terminals on the ground. You board and they take you to predesignated stops in a direct line, free of traffic. Like a shuttle or train, only on a smaller scale, and ideally seats come in much more frequently, every 30 seconds or so."
3260,10,137,['traffic'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
3261,10,137,['traffic'],"A human carrying drone. This would require it to be build and withstand certain weight thresholds, such as up to 200 pounds. You would call a drone in and let it know where you want to go. It would pick you up and fly you there at a decent rate of speed and without having to sit in traffic."
3262,10,137,['traffic'],"A magnetic roadway system, where people move in modular pods that are controlled by a central operating system (COS). Magnets underneath the street guide your pod along, and every movement of all of the pods is controlled perfectly by the computerized system, it is completely autonomous. If your whole family wants to go into town, you assemble your four-pod system and take off, where traffic is optimized perfectly by the COS. If just you are on your way to work, you hop in your single passenger pod, and take off!"
3263,10,137,['traffic'],"A moving sidewalk - like the ones you would see in an airport to help expedite movement between terminals.  Around my area there are a lot of close shops, so people could walk, but getting loads of bags home would be difficult.  Having mechanical walkways would enable people to do their shopping but reduce their need to use cars, and at the same time set all their bags down so they don't have to figure out how to lug them home, especially if they've purchased something heavy.  It could also allow people to get where they need to go faster, if they continue to walk along the moving sidewalk.  They could sit alongside regular sidewalks, so people who still wanted to go out for a walk and get some fresh air could do so.  The mechanical/moving sidewalks would be made out of metal, look like a flat escalator, have hand railings, and each side of the road would have a sidewalk that goes the same way as traffic."
3264,10,137,['traffic'],"A network of quadcopters (drones) large enough to transport humans. Let's say you need to get to the other side of town quickly, and want to avoid traffic -- get in a drone and have it deliver you by air!"
3265,10,137,['traffic'],A new form of transportation that could be well used in my community would be a large seating vehicle that took people on and off the local military bases. There are 5 bases here and in the morning and evening commute there are traffic issues around those bases. A way to remove at least half the vehicles could cut down on pollution and traffic around the base for people off the base as well as on. This would be a military carpool of sorts to also eliminate parking issues.
3266,10,137,['traffic'],"A new transportation system  can be something somewhat like a train, but a small train like shuttle, which can take others around the neighborhood, easy, fast and no traffic."
3267,10,137,['traffic'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
3268,10,137,['traffic'],A online map real time of the buses and trains the area. Buses and trains aren't usually on time and having real on time traffic will show if its a bad bad to drive.
3269,10,137,['traffic'],"A person's place of employment, such as a hospital could conceivably shuttle employees from home to work via a small bus. The city or county could be divided into quadrants to further facilitate timely pickups. This would definitely free up traffic if the workplace had 9000+ employees."
3270,10,137,['traffic'],"A sort of rail line, but it's a single rail and has many hanging carts. The carts hold maybe 4 people at a time, like a taxi. The price would be cheaper than a bus and they would arrive quickly when you need them. You could push a button on poles that are located around the city, far more often than bus stops, and the cart will come to you quickly and take you directly to your destination. No need for bus drivers or waiting for traffic!"
3271,10,137,['traffic'],"A subway system in my city is badly needed. We have terrible traffic and everything in the city is built in a grid system. It would save time, money and gas consumption for millions."
3272,10,137,['traffic'],"A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."
3273,10,137,['traffic'],"A train to the beach.  The beach is about an hour from our town (or three hours with summer traffic), and all traffic to the beach comes through our town due to an important bridge.  We could have a train that leaves from our town, or other stops nearby, and then expresses to the beach.  People would need extra room for luggage - or you could couple it with a luggage delivery system.  It would cut down on time to the beach and the number of cars on the road."
3274,10,137,['traffic'],"A train would be useful in my city. It would be most useful to travel out to other nearby cities. Traffic is extremely bad on the interstate where I live, and a train would be incredibly useful for traveling to the popular cities surrounding my city."
3275,10,137,['traffic'],"A zip line from the place where I take the bus to the subway would be great. It would cut out all the traffic and possibly be much faster than taking the bus to the subway. Also, there would be multiple pods that would lock in the destination and go non-stop so it wouldn't be stopping every few minutes to pick up passengers."
3276,10,137,['traffic'],An AI that tells certain buses or train to slow down at a certain rate to decrease accidents making traffic more efficient.
3277,10,137,['traffic'],"an app that takes into account both traffic and train congestion, as well as the speeds to walk or bike, to tell you the fastest mode of transport to a destination. For example, train  might typically be quicker to get from A to B, but when trains are spaced 20 minutes apart late at night and there is no traffic, driving/taxi would be faster."
3278,10,137,['traffic'],"An expansion of the skyrail or a similar system with connection to the skyrail could be added to the surrounding cities of Seattle. The addition of public transportation would cut pollution and reduce traffic congestion with the plus side of convenience. It would be a good idea to implement this idea while we still have space available, rather than wait until the problem is a burden."
3279,10,137,['traffic'],"An overhead puppy cart system, the same concept as in skii resorts. I live in NYC, and outside of traveling by train, there are no other practicals transportation which avoids traffic. Unlike the the train system, you would be able to make direct routes, with a bonus of great views around the city"
3280,10,137,['traffic'],An underground rail system would be great. That way you could get around without having to get stuck in traffic.  There are so many cars in this area that we are known for our traffic.
3281,10,137,['traffic'],"An underground Seqway track which will take a while to build but will be extremely beneficial. There are no turns as underground paths are completely straight. Recharger stations are at every mile or two. There are practically no intersections or traffic lights except at major hubs, which are few and far between. Delivery services such as mail and UPS are a major component of this transportation system, which will make them faster and clear up traffic on major roads."
3282,10,137,['traffic'],An underground walkway would be useful in my neighbourhood because you would not need to stop traffic to cross the street.
3283,10,137,['traffic'],Any type of hoover mode of transportation allowing driver to avoid accidents and hoover past slow moving traffic.
3284,10,137,['traffic'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
3285,10,137,['traffic'],"autonomous vehicles abound. there are shared autonomous vehicles that can be called by neighborhood members. you may travel to destinations within your town only. the cost is shared by real estate tax. the benefit is a drastic reduction in traffic congestion, as much fewer cars are needed."
3286,10,137,['traffic'],Autonomous vehicles will take over 75% of the local traffic. Autonomous public transport will handle the inter-city traffic.
3287,10,137,['traffic'],"Chicago - Chicago has a great system and phenomenal public transport. As far as transportation though I wish the highways in the city acted like slotted cars, similar to trains in which in every highway entrance there would be a dedicated lane/railway for vehicles to travel at fast speeds like trains. This would reduce traffic and travel times."
3288,10,137,['traffic'],Close some roads to motorized traffic and allow only bicycles. offering a local tax incentive for bicycling
3289,10,137,['traffic'],"Create a taxpayer-funded service like Uber, but dedicated to carpooling people. Since people are already paying for it there would be an incentive to using it. This would ease traffic and reduce pollution."
3290,10,137,['traffic'],Drones that carry people - flying cars if you will.  Lucky owners will fly over traffic jams with ease and get to work in record time.
3291,10,137,['traffic'],"Due to the amount of traffic around Tampa and surrounding towns, there is much congestion during rush hours. To help alleviate some of this, I suggest uni-directional bridge to be built that reduce traffic during rush hours. In the morning, the bridge would allow traffic going west towards the base. In the evening, traffic would flow to the east."
3292,10,137,['traffic'],electronic billboards that tell which routes to take that currently have less traffic
3293,10,137,['traffic'],Encourage biking by providing dedicated bike lanes that are safe from vehicular traffic.
3294,10,137,['traffic'],Firefighters are using jet-packs in Dubai to combat fires in skyscrapers. I propose we use jet-packs for personal transport. It's hard enough to travel in big cities like Miami with all the traffic. Having your own jet pack allows you to literally fly away from a stressful situation such as sitting in traffic or waiting for public transportation. It will save time and is fun. This futuristic technology is here and it works.
3295,10,137,['traffic'],"For transportation in my neighborhood we have cars, and buses. The most popular mode of transportation being the four door family sedan type car. Following that it's the minivan and then the four-door trucks. They can be seen whizzing back and forth on the roads causing many traffic jams during peak morning hours."
3296,10,137,['traffic'],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
3297,10,137,['traffic'],Future transportation is the Shower transporter. You get ready for where you want to go and then simply hop in the shower and press a button to be teleported to your pre-progammed destination. E.g. you will have regular places like your work and supermarket already programmed in with addresses. The shower will pop out through your roof and drop you off at your destination by taking the sky-way and then return home. Just remember to take your shower calling watch with you to buzz your shower teleport back when you want to return home. No more traffic no more waiting no more parking just flying showers :)
3298,10,137,['traffic'],Have a system of skylift that can transport people within the city. This could really reduce traffic congestion. This network goes above the ground traffic and moves quickly.
3299,10,137,['traffic'],"Have scooters that people can rent, this would reduce pollution and traffic."
3300,10,137,['traffic'],helicopter rides when lots of traffic
3301,10,137,['traffic'],Human Tubes where people slide through interconnected tubes throughout the city in order to bypass traffic.
3302,10,137,['traffic'],"I am thinking about a flying transport system. It should fly with balloon or air system. It should not need engine or fuel. So expence would be cheap. It should occupy 15-25 people at a time. It moves with air adjustment, drag, thrust, pressure etc. The flyer lands every important point in a city. So people can travel across the city with less time and money. No traffic block, signals, air pollution etc."
3303,10,137,['traffic'],"I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
3304,10,137,['traffic'],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
3305,10,137,['traffic'],"I could imagine single rider tram cars. The cars would be tethered to cables above the streets. Something akin to ski lift carriage, but completely enclosed in glass. Advantage would be thy could run off electric current and would reduce ground street traffic"
3306,10,137,['traffic'],"I get out of my house and before I leave my apartment on my 12th floor I just press a button on my app on my phone to type a location of the place i need to go.This would in turn contact all local data base systems of GPS based transport systems irrespective of the vendors available or government supported transport systems which include Cabs,Buses,Trains,Subway,3 Wheelers and most importantly assuming the people of the future will care a lot more about the environment and all the people who are going alone in a 5 seater car would have a option of sharing there carbon footprint left by the vehicle.And if the co-ordinates of the person with the car and the co-ordinates of the Person who is using the app matches then a Random Unique (one time use)Number or Picture or Anything which would be visible from atleast 10 feet away on a Min 6 inch screen.However this interface can be avoided by tracking the dots on the GPS system or by sending a snap shot of the car number or a photo of the person himself which will be destroyed automatically by the system once the person is down from the Vehicle.Punch Line Before I get to the main gates of the apartment.I should have the list of Vehicles available to me and the time it would take the vehicle to reach my place based on GPS and traffic conditions and also how much time would it take to reach my destination again based on real time traffic conditions and also most importantly.if i take  the public transport system.How much time would it take to reach the same destination and also how much Carbon foot print would i save from doing it.And also the time required by the vehicle to reach the local transport systems if it is not a walkable distance.There are many more ,But i think that is enough for the day.

GIVE THE CUSTOMER ALL THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS OF COMMUTING WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE COST AND THE TIME INVOLVED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VENDOR OR GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS..."
3307,10,137,['traffic'],"I imagine a loop in my city where anyone would be able to have a short walk to the 'main artery' and be able to get anywhere at a major point within minutes; perhaps this would be a rail suspended above the city, or otherwise away from other major traffic; it would really help in efficiency of moving people around."
3308,10,137,['traffic'],I imagine a taxi speed boat that could take you downtown in a matter of minutes. It will help skip all the traffic on the street and cut your time in half. Perfect for people who live by bodies of water and are in a rush like NYC.
3309,10,137,['traffic'],I imagine a type of highway for bicycles where people can use on and off ramps easily to reach their destination. They wont have to worry about cars since its a bike only highway system. it will get people to their destination quicker since they dont have to stop at traffic lights and watch out for pedestrians.
3310,10,137,['traffic'],"I live in a pretty population dense area where most things people need (like a hospital, a big job center, homes, grocery store) are pretty close to each other.  I think this set up begs for a monorail.  It would be elevated so wouldn't interfere with current traffic too much, but would provide a nice transportation system for people to take for short trips."
3311,10,137,['traffic'],"I live in a rural area, it's pretty hilly but it runs along the length of a valley. It would be really nice to have a walking/bike path that connects the residential neighborhood to the commercial district without having the bike/walk on the road. Although it's generally slow traffic, walking on the road is never exactly safe. Especially in the winter. To be able to network together the few towns in the valley too would be very nice."
3312,10,137,['traffic'],"I live in a small desert city with a major traffic congestion issue. However, despite the grid layout of the town, there is a diagonal irrigation canal running from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. Currently it has some poorly maintained walking paths, but that's about the extent of its development. Now, in the desert, loss of irrigation water to evaporation under the glaring sun is an issue. I'd propose creating a covered walkway/bike path where solar panels provide protection to the water, as well as pedestrians and cyclists. We could even use that solar energy to create small electric scooter rental/charging booths. It would provide a shortcut - a green highway from one end of town to the other."
3313,10,137,['traffic'],"I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
3314,10,137,['traffic'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
3315,10,137,['traffic'],"I think a method that would improve the transportation system would be to change how turn lanes are handled in America. Overseas, to turn left, you veer off to a lane on the right that comes to a stop so that you don't block traffic waiting to turn and then when it is clear, you drive across the street onto the road you were going to turn onto."
3316,10,137,['traffic'],I think a spiral starting from the center of the city going out to the edges of the city.  The spiral should be able to get all the areas if it's only 2-3 blocks wide.  It would have a dedicated lane so traffic wouldn't affect the bus and vice versa.  There would be a way to quickly have people enter and exit the bus and this would keep it on time.  Of course the bus is electric powered.
3317,10,137,['traffic'],I think a trolley system would work really well here. I live in Fort Collins and the city is very centralized but the traffic is terrible - perfect for a trolley!
3318,10,137,['traffic'],"I think teleportation would be awesome. Wouldn't need cars anymore, save on oil and fumes in the environment. People would be happier because they wouldn't be stuck in traffic or have to drive hours to see long distance family members."
3319,10,137,['traffic'],"I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
3320,10,137,['traffic'],"I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
3321,10,137,['traffic'],"I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
3322,10,137,['traffic'],I would like our city to have a railway system like downtown Miami. Its computer operated and is over ground. This means it wont impact traffic at all. Its a fast and easy service and its going to make things easier for all.
3323,10,137,['traffic'],I would like to see a cable car that runs across the city.  It would take people across the busy streets.  It would be convenient for office workers. It would cut down on traffic in the downtown area.
3324,10,137,['traffic'],I would like to see a hover system that occupies the same route as roads and highways to bypass traffic.
3325,10,137,['traffic'],"I would like to see a system built around ""people movers"" - similar to the ride that was once at Disneyland.  It would run underneath the ground - under the traffic.  Each car would hold one or two people with large reclining chairs and a docking station for your laptop so you can watch movies, play games or actually do work."
3326,10,137,['traffic'],I would like to see jetpacks so people can go long distances in a short amount of time without relatively much traffic. The cost would hopefully be relatively cheap as well once they were mass produced.
3327,10,137,['traffic'],"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
3328,10,137,['traffic'],I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
3329,10,137,['traffic'],"I would like to see public transportation on buses expanded in my area, with a dedicated area for bicycles to also be transported on the buses.  This would help a lot with traffic, and still allow people to get to their destinations quickly."
3330,10,137,['traffic'],I would love to see more light rail transit added to Pittsburgh to alleviate some of the traffic congestion under ground
3331,10,137,['traffic'],"I'd like to see shuttle trams in my area. It's a small section based urban area that has about four different areas all residents will have to visit at some point in time. If we had a shuttle system that specifically transported people from a central point to the four primary destinations it would incredibly reduce the use of fossil fuels, traffic, and accidents in the area."
3332,10,137,['traffic'],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
3333,10,137,['traffic'],I'd like to see some sort of autonomous shared fleet of cars that are fueled in some sort of environmentally friendly way. Solar panels on the roof? Maybe bike pedaling inside if you want to exercise and provide a small amount of power? I feel like autonomous cars alone will save a ton of energy just by eliminating traffic jams. And cut down on wind resistance since you wouldn't need to keep the traditional design necessarily.
3334,10,137,['traffic'],"If we could be so technologically advanced to create giant versions of the airport conveyor belts where humans are carried across, that would be my new method of transportation. Since people are mostly lazy and want something to do the work for them (hence the upcoming popularity of the hands-free segway), this would be perfect to eliminate at least a fourth of the traffic on the street from cars."
3335,10,137,['traffic'],"In many neighborhoods, stop signs are ignored. I believe switching to yield signs, where ideally suitable, is needed and adding 'bus stops' for local schools that do not hinder traffic."
3336,10,137,['traffic'],"In the interest of reducing traffic and accidents, a new series of self-driving only roads and lanes are opened.  On these roads, ONLY self driving cars are authorized to drive, and on them there are no speed limits (not that the self-driving cars would be going that much faster than normal). Unfettered by the chaos of common roads and the limitations of human judgement, these exclusively self-driving vehicle areas allow the navigational AIs to coordinate for an optimally fast and efficient journey."
3337,10,137,['traffic'],"Invest in personal helicopters, these would be like the size of a small above ground pool. They won't take up much space and they'll allow people to get around faster since they won't be stuck in traffic."
3338,10,137,['traffic'],It would be cool (although pretty difficult to actually create) to have a gondola lift public transportation system that had cars that could travel over the streets and take people places avoiding traffic! There'd be stops that had elevators and stairs to get up to them and basically they'd just be suspended a bit above the streets and you could travel nicely between them over all the traffic below.
3339,10,137,['traffic'],It would be effective to create a bike club in my neighborhood.  We would choose at least 1 day a week to ride our bikes to work decreasing neighborhood traffic and air pollution.  This bike club would host meetings once a month and reward people who rode the most days to work that month incentivizing people to ride more often.
3340,10,137,['traffic'],maybe a flying car to avoid traffic
3341,10,137,['traffic'],"Monorail through the city! Just like Disneyland, this city-wide system allows you to see the city from a bird's eye! Simply get on at one of the many stations around town and enjoy your ride without stops, traffic or bad weather. The rails above the city means growth can continue without getting in the way of transport, and means you can watch the world below!"
3342,10,137,['traffic'],"More bike lanes, or a sky tram to get around, traffic around here is weird."
3343,10,137,['traffic'],"most of the people are going office by car . In rainy season if you go by car that is not problem.but scooter using people and children are affected by rain . for that if we fix wind resistant ,water resistant umbrella in the bike . In the handle bar that will be very useful for two wheelers .If we make that kind of vehicle that will become very successful .because of rain only most of the people will go by car . or else they will go by scooter. that will reduce the traffic jam."
3344,10,137,['traffic'],my city needs a subway system badly. A subway system would run in a star shaped pattern through the city and eliminate the terrible traffic in my city
3345,10,137,['traffic'],"My city would benefit from an elevated and enclosed train line. Regional rail is the preferred choice for many commuters but is unreliable and frustrating due to weather and traffic related delays. Though the infrastructure investment would be great, we are in need of an overhaul anyway and should improve the current system."
3346,10,137,['traffic'],"My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."
3347,10,137,['traffic'],My idea is to build an app for uber drivers that show all the short cuts to a location. Even if they have to drive through residential areas. The app will calculate the shortest distance and time depending on traffic.
3348,10,137,['traffic'],My Idea would be to make the alleyways in my city a lot more bike friendly.  Honestly they are very rarely ever used by the city or homeowners so to make them this way would be beneficial for so many others. This would I believe encourage more people to use bicycles since I know I am terrified when riding my bicycle next to extremely lage and fast moving automobile traffic on my cities roads and highways.
3349,10,137,['traffic'],"My mom had this silly idea the other day when we were sitting in traffic. Cars that change shape depending on however many people were in it. Say, two people? It'd transform into a smartcar size. One person? Tiny one-person cubicle machine. Sure, it's not really feasible - but it's interesting. It'd make traffic feel less terrible if we could see how many people are in said car and how fast they'd be crossing streets and so on. Maybe have a designated lane for however many people?"
3350,10,137,['traffic'],"my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops. People will be able to travel to any part of the world without going through airports and flight connections. There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
3351,10,137,['traffic'],"One day per month (at least) cars should be banned from the roads. Some buses could be allowed to allow for transportation of people who can't walk or bike, but this would be a great way to encourage human-powered transport and allow people to see the fun in this activity without increased danger from car traffic.  This would also be great for the environment."
3352,10,137,['traffic'],"One thing I would love to see in my local area is rent able electric scooters. They would be good for the environment, easy to maintain, and reduce traffic in terms of larger vehicles on the road."
3353,10,137,['traffic'],our city is metro .population is a big problem there and traffic too .large no of people use public transport like trains and buses but also use scooter in large nos as its easy to go to places when there is lot of traffic on rads to avoid jams.
3354,10,137,['traffic'],"Public, foot-based transportation. Something like the automatic walkways in airports, but for long stretches of large cities, particularly between common high-traffic areas. It would probably be best if the walkways were raised, to avoid conflict with other ground traffic. It must also include access for the disabled, be easy enough for even tech-fearful users, and extremely safe (with monitored auto-shutoff where applicable)."
3355,10,137,['traffic'],remove all non commercial traffic.  have extensive light rail connected to robust subway system.  have storage containers deliver large goods.
3356,10,137,['traffic'],Segways!  Segway sidewalks that go over streets and above the normal sidewalks people walk on so you can ride your segway without stopping for traffic or having to worry about a pedestrian taking up space to get by. Segway sidewalks can even run on the edge of a major highway in bigger cities like mine to keep routes short and simple. We can even make the segways charge on solar power so they will never go dead while you're out running about.
3357,10,137,['traffic'],Self-driving vehicles will be linked into a computerized grid that will adjust traffic flow and density to most efficiently transport people from point A to B.
3358,10,137,['traffic'],"Since rail is very expensive, I'd like to see more express bus routes, hopefully with their own lanes to keep them flowing faster than traffic and give an incentive to use them.  Make the buses as comfortable as possible, again as an incentive for use."
3359,10,137,['traffic'],Smarter stop lights that are better at managing traffic congestion
3360,10,137,['traffic'],Some kind of public transportation like light rail that goes nearby would be ideal. If we could have a light rail or subway system that connects the city to the suburbs that would greatly improve the traffic situation.
3361,10,137,['traffic'],Some type of underground or above-ground monorail system to help with the massive traffic problem in my area. With stations in key locations that are unobtrusive to the overall community.
3362,10,137,['traffic'],"Something above the streets, an elevated form of public transportation, would be cool. That way it would be out of the traffic."
3363,10,137,['traffic'],Something like Uber but with people on motorbikes than can weave in and out of deadlocked traffic during rush hour
3364,10,137,['traffic'],Subway that takes you straight to downtown. It would be the best transportation to get to downtown without any traffic to watch football games get to work and other activities. I think a lot more people would be traveling this way.
3365,10,137,['traffic'],"Tampa, FL is one of the largest metro areas in the country without any sort of rail system, and traffic is bad. I would love to see a commuter rail system in our town, with a downtown hub and then lines extending north to the Wesley Chapel/Lutz area, out to Brandon, and then another line out to the Westshore/Airport area."
3366,10,137,['traffic'],"The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
3367,10,137,['traffic'],The future of transportation in my city is by having self-automated driverless cars. They would reduce the amount of traffic congestion and reduce the number of car accidents.
3368,10,137,['traffic'],The future transportation system in my neighborhood would possibly incorporate traffic light systems that would detect the amount of traffic and flow to better keep traffic moving and prevent long lines and wait times at intersections therefor reducing trip times and automobile emissions.
3369,10,137,['traffic'],The system will be based off cable cars.  It's cheaper and easier to put up than bridges or building tunnels.  They will have their own traffic free paths.  The paths can even intersect by having the cables much higher than the other line's.  There can be platforms every so often so people can get on and off but not too many as to keep cost and commute time down.
3370,10,137,['traffic'],The transportation system would be a combination of roads with cars and a railroad track. All of the cars would be connected and be able to drive themselves. Cars would all be on tracks and controlled by the car itself. This would lower accidents and allow for better traffic. Cars would be able to accelerate much faster as there is no driver intervention and you don't have to wait for other cars to accelerate or worry about where other cars are going.
3371,10,137,['traffic'],"The transportation would be efficient; it would be green and rely on newer energies that are not dependent upon fossil fuels. It also would be future-proof, such that it would reduce and combat the issues of traffic jams and collisions. We still would have private and public transportation, allowing people to make the choice of which is better for their needs. There also would be strict requirements for those who choose to drive; thus reducing the amount of likely collisions. It would be affordable and allow society to continue to grow and prosper."
3372,10,137,['traffic'],"There are many back roads and residential routes around my neighborhood, so speed isn't as much of an issue to keep pace with traffic. I'd imagine a fleet of scooters that could be rented cheaply and easily could help residents get around town without much issue."
3373,10,137,['traffic'],"There are many parts of my area that aren't accessible by foot or bicycle; in order to get from one section of town to another, you have to take a highway, where only motorized vehicles area allowed. This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
3374,10,137,['traffic'],There could be a really good motorcycle driver that would drive fast and come pick you up. He would know back roads and side allys very well. He could weve in and out of traffic and get you somewhere really fast.
3375,10,137,['traffic'],There would be a pay-to-use bicycle system similar to the Citi bicycles in New York City. It would allow people to exercise while getting to their location quickly. It would also relieve traffic congestion.
3376,10,137,['traffic'],This area could really use a super speed train that goes much faster than traffic. It could travel above the road system and would save tons of time for many people.
3377,10,137,['traffic'],This idea is about cable bus. Bus moving through cable in air. The cables are places all across the city in air. The bus moves across the cable without any traffic block. There will be stops.
3378,10,137,['traffic'],"This might be only useful for some places, but it's better than none.  I think there should be a moving walkway for the most common areas of a town or city.  This way foot traffic can be consistent and the flow high.  Since it's fairly low speed there shouldn't be any injury issues and transferring is as easy as getting off the one walkway and on to another."
3379,10,137,['traffic'],To reduce gridlock and rush hour traffic governments should offer tax incentives for employers offering a staggered work day. I.e. Employees scheduled to be gin work at different times rather than the 7-10 o'clock  morning hour.
3380,10,137,['traffic'],Underground walkways at traffic intersections. This would eliminate the need for crosswalks and improve the flow of traffic.
3381,10,137,['traffic'],"Use CNG Gas in Autos, Taxi, Buses and Other Public Transport System.

Encouarge People to use Public Transport System to avoid Traffic Congestion and Air Pollution.

Give Tax Subsidies for Less Pollution Technologies."
3382,10,137,['traffic'],Use of a sky tram.  It runs over the roads so that it doesn't increase traffic.
3383,10,137,['traffic'],Using boats to travel in Miami to beat the rush hour traffic. It's quite simple to travel anywhere in Miami by using the canals and various waterways. Boats or ferries should be used not just for sight seeing but for public transportation.
3384,10,137,['traffic'],"vehicles that life themselves to allow ""stacking"" of cars, this would reduce traffic by half."
3385,10,137,['traffic'],"Walking tunnels that are elevated, so you are safer from traffic, and enclosed in plexiglass so it is weather-proof but also safe because people can see you."
3386,10,137,['traffic'],"we need dedicated motorcycle streets, preferably underground, i live in a very populated city (not LA status but still very urban) and ive often thought that a small underground road system built primarily for two wheeled street vehicles would not only cut down on traffic but the pollotuion created could them be trapped and prevented from being released into the atmosphere... it would cause motorcycle sales to skyrocket and there by provide another added economic benefit."
3387,10,137,['traffic'],We ought to revisit the trolley system because the buses in New York City are plagued by heavy traffic. We should have electric trolleys on main thoroughfares. It worked in the old days. Sometimes old ideas mixed with new technology is GENIUS!
3388,10,137,['traffic'],We should have an underground subway system. For a city as large as the one I live in it would make sense. It would be faster for everyone and clear the roads of buses that clog up traffic during rush hour.
3389,10,137,['traffic'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
3390,10,137,['traffic'],"A human carrying drone. This would require it to be build and withstand certain weight thresholds, such as up to 200 pounds. You would call a drone in and let it know where you want to go. It would pick you up and fly you there at a decent rate of speed and without having to sit in traffic."
3391,11,131,['bike'],"A bicycle rental system that allows town-owned bicycles to be ""checked out"" at various locations throughout the city, and returned to any of several locations. This will encourage people to ride bikes, even if they do not own them themselves."
3392,11,131,['bike'],A bike path that has a divider between the road and the bike path. A dedicated bike path that has a sense of security could encourage more people to bike around town since they wouldn't need to share the road with cars.
3393,11,131,['bike'],A bike path that is in place of all the roads. No cars will be allowed. There will be no worrying about being hit by a car when riding your bike.
3394,11,131,['bike'],"A bike rental service that lest customers rent bikes for reasonable rates daily or weekly, with pick up and return spots very conveniently located around the city"
3395,11,131,['bike'],A bike with jet packs
3396,11,131,['bike'],"A both walking and bike lane that provides safety from traffic, is well lit, and connects key locations around the neighborhood."
3397,11,131,['bike'],A cargo bike rental that came with discounts at supermarkets and hardware stores.
3398,11,131,['bike'],A flying bike that can come straight to you with a click of a button from your phone or tablet.
3399,11,131,['bike'],A hover board sharing service. Like a car rental but with hover boards. Must be located near bike paths.
3400,11,131,['bike'],A larger bike path so that more people could ride their bikes places. Also every few miles they could have a bench for people to rest with a water fountain.
3401,11,131,['bike'],"A multiple person bike system that converts all the energy created in a moderate speed. This system has an own lane and its free for users, its an ecological way to get to any given detination."
3402,11,131,['bike'],"A network of green transportation for rent. You insert coins and it releases a bike, a skateboard, a scooter or some other form of efficient transportation. You drive it to your destination and once you deliver it to the hotpspot you can get your money back, if it is in good condition."
3403,11,131,['bike'],"A new transportation idea would be to have bikes that can be rented.  I have seen this in some towns such as Austin, Texas.  Where you can find a bank of rental bikes every couple of blocks.  How awesome would it be if this was more normal and people could choose to ride a bike to the store to grab a loaf of bread or something, rather than getting in the car and wasting gas and adding to pollution."
3404,11,131,['bike'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
3405,11,131,['bike'],"A rail cart, that is powered by friction and capturing the head it produces while being driven down the rail, it starts with a simple pedal of a bike to create enough momentum and friction to start the process going and then as soon as you produce enough energy to get it moving, it will continue to produce and move forward till you press the brakes. BAM!"
3406,11,131,['bike'],A rent a bike program. Where you can rent and return electric bicycles. It could be either manned by a person or just a machine.
3407,11,131,['bike'],A rent a bike system. Solar powered bikes could be rented for 1$ and returned at different stations for a refund of 1$.
3408,11,131,['bike'],A small personal car that ran on solar energy that was no larger than a bike.  It could be stored on a bike rack and had enough energy to go 15 miles on a charge.  Charging time would only be an hour if and when it needed to plug into electric.  The biggest thing is that it would keep the occupant dry.
3409,11,131,['bike'],"a system of bikes that one can rent for free. Bike racks are located every few miles. People can use a key to scan and take out a bike, and return it at any of the racks in the area."
3410,11,131,['bike'],A system with bike racks so people can rent bikes and ride around would be nice. There can be multiple areas to be rented from.
3411,11,131,['bike'],"A transportation system would include wide use of self-driving cars to facilitate efficiency and safety. Cars may be privately owned, or there may be a pay-as-you go or contract type system if you do not wish to own a vehicle. There would also be a total bike lane system for those who prefer to ride bicycles. The bike lanes would be much safer than what exists now."
3412,11,131,['bike'],"an app that takes into account both traffic and train congestion, as well as the speeds to walk or bike, to tell you the fastest mode of transport to a destination. For example, train  might typically be quicker to get from A to B, but when trains are spaced 20 minutes apart late at night and there is no traffic, driving/taxi would be faster."
3413,11,131,['bike'],"An electric bicycle train. Everyone has their own bike, but they can all hook up to a belt that would transport them at the same speed and direction in a safe manner, maybe even on its own road."
3414,11,131,['bike'],"An underground network system in the neighborhood, like a subway but only bikes and small motorcycles can travel through. This will be a good way to protect against the weather and steer clear of any incoming cars."
3415,11,131,['bike'],"An underground tunnel system just for people, bikes and mopeds.  The idea is that all the cars and congestion can stay up above and people can safely walk or transport themselves around without worrying about cars and busses getting in the way or being run over by them.  Every so often there is a ramp that allows you to exit, as well as natural light through grates and proper ventilation.  It would also be a great way to get around when it snows."
3416,11,131,['bike'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
3417,11,131,['bike'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
3418,11,131,['bike'],Bike pathway bridges above the city. These pathways could connect schools and business and making them convenient would encourage more people to ride and less driving.
3419,11,131,['bike'],bike rickshaw
3420,11,131,['bike'],bike sharing stands would be a welcome addition to my city.  Bikes you can rent at one place and drop off somewhere else.
3421,11,131,['bike'],Bike taxies -- hook up a carriage to a bike and charge people for short-distance rides
3422,11,131,['bike'],"biking system, where people can rent bikes and use them and drop them off at other stations."
3423,11,131,['bike'],"Bus passes can be used for bike passes also.  Take the bus as far as it goes, then  switch to a bike or scooter for rent."
3424,11,131,['bike'],"Buses that have the ability to carry bikes for their customers.

Many people don't live next to a bus station and ride their bikes there so if the bus had a place for the bikes it would really help the customers out."
3425,11,131,['bike'],"City buses that actually go downtown and to the places that people need to go, instead of just around the edges of town. Also, have a fleet of bikes that people could rent for $1/hr to ride the distances downtown like some other cities."
3426,11,131,['bike'],"Covered and underground or above ground lanes for bikes, pedestrians, and disabled that are always protected from inclement weather."
3427,11,131,['bike'],Developing a bike path throughout the neighborhood that goes directly to business locations would encourage more people to ride bikes and drive their cars less.  This bike path could snake all around the city with entries directly to all business locations making it an easy option for people.

3429,11,131,['bike'],"Electric bicycles that work only within a specified area. Like shopping carts that lock wheels when taken too far away from the store, these bikes would lock up when taken outside the area. Anyone can use these bikes within this area."
3430,11,131,['bike'],Encourage biking by providing dedicated bike lanes that are safe from vehicular traffic.
3431,11,131,['bike'],Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
3432,11,131,['bike'],extremely light rail. People hop into 1 person rail cars that take up less room than a bike lane. There would be no waiting at the rail station because it leaves as soon as you get in.

3434,11,131,['bike'],For the future we introduce solar bikes.
3435,11,131,['bike'],Free bike exchange drop off type situation with buy in.  I'd like to pay a small fee to get a key to buy into a bike exchange that would be availible outside a number of locations spread thoughout the small city to use when i wish.
3436,11,131,['bike'],Have an app for parents of kids who go to the same school where they can carpool and share rides to the same events. I live in a climate where these is severe weather so telling people to walk and ride bikes is only good in the summer!
3437,11,131,['bike'],Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.
3438,11,131,['bike'],I can use the battery bike to avoid the air pollution in my home town
3439,11,131,['bike'],I imagine a type of highway for bicycles where people can use on and off ramps easily to reach their destination. They wont have to worry about cars since its a bike only highway system. it will get people to their destination quicker since they dont have to stop at traffic lights and watch out for pedestrians.
3440,11,131,['bike'],"I imagine hover bikes in the future, powered by solar energy."
3441,11,131,['bike'],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town. I can see the current roads changing to smaller lanes made for electric vehicles while most of the transportation needs will be fulfilled with bike and walking paths and personal hoverboard type of transportation.
3442,11,131,['bike'],"I think a good idea will be to use electric cycles instead of a bike or a car in metros. They not only help in decreasing pollution as well as motivating people towards physical exercises.



A proper network of e cycles and connected to a main frame can be seen as a new transportation system emerging. Moreover this can also be used as a public transportation system by constructing cycle stands where they can be charged and the cost of public transport can be paid in the machine."

3445,11,131,['bike'],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
3446,11,131,['bike'],"I think it would be cool if there were kisoks you could rent bicycles from.  Maybe put a gps tracker inside of them so people didn't try to steal them, or give people back part of their deposit when they returned the bike to another kisok."
3447,11,131,['bike'],I think my neighborhood could benefit from ride-sharing bikes. We live in a suburb of Boston but technically a City. Not the easiest to get around and a lot to do.
3448,11,131,['bike'],I think my neighborhood would benefit from one of those pedal bike bars for the downtown area. There is a lot of history and what better way to enjoy it than while sipping a nice drink and getting some exercise
3449,11,131,['bike'],"I think that a cool new transportation system would be a bike that we all pedal. It would be a long bike, maybe 5-8 seats long on each side. It would start with one rider who will then ride to other people's houses to pick others up. They would get on the bike and start peddling to pick the next person up."
3450,11,131,['bike'],"I think that a new mod of transportation in my neighborhood would be a electric bike taxi system. It would be an electric bike pulling a carriage that hold up to 3 other people. The system will travel from people's houses to their work place, local shopping centers and local entertainment places."
3451,11,131,['bike'],I think that public buses should have some type of bike rack on the back of the bus. Some people want to take their bikes with them somewhere but the place is to far to bike the whole way.  The can chain their bike to the bike rack and remove it when they get off the bus. Of course space would be limited to about 2-3 bikes.
3452,11,131,['bike'],"I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
3453,11,131,['bike'],"I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
3454,11,131,['bike'],I think there should be bikes that you can easily rent. You can get them in the major shopping areas and drive them around town to get excercise as well as helping to use less gasoline.
3455,11,131,['bike'],I think we need a greener alternative to the uber/lyft types of services. Perhaps an app that connects you to bike and rickshaw drivers. Like an uber or lyft for rickshaws. I took a cycle rickshaw after a music festival this summer and it was great. Took a while to get to the destination but it felt really cool to get a ride from a biker.
3456,11,131,['bike'],"I think we should focus on making it easier for people to bike around the area. We need to widen sidewalks and/or have separate paths just for pedestrians and bikers. Oftentimes, the bike lanes are narrow or end abruptly."
3457,11,131,['bike'],"I want a large, underground series of tunnels that offer a combination of walking paths, bike paths, and people movers so that people can easily move around the city during winter. As this would have a large number of entrances and exists, it would be more flexible (and cheaper) than the subway."
3458,11,131,['bike'],"I wish we could get treadmill bikes. I saw a quick video of one invented in the U.K. I think. You walk on it and that powers a motor so you can move quickly even if you are just walking. We have many runners and walkers in our city, but only on trails or parks. If you could use them on the streets to actually get places it would be wonderful. You would also have to add some sort of safe parking places so they don't get stolen as I'm not sure you can lock them up."
3459,11,131,['bike'],I would like it if the area I lived in used a bike sharing system like I have seen in some other major cities like Portland and Minneapolis.
3460,11,131,['bike'],"I would like to see a bicycle highway.  It would go the length of regular highways, but be for bikes and pedestrians.  It should be wide enough for fast moving road cyclist, it should have passing lanes, and little road crossings.  There should be frequent on and off ramps.  There should also be many large parking areas.  Ideally it would even lead to public transportation areas with ample bike parking."
3461,11,131,['bike'],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
3462,11,131,['bike'],"I would love it if the city made walking and riding a bike more user friendly. There are no areas that are safe for pedestrians or bikers. If there were a bike lane, more people could move independently and get to where they are going. Commuters using more than one mode of transportation would be able to get to their destinations more quickly and with greater safety."
3463,11,131,['bike'],I'd like to see some sort of autonomous shared fleet of cars that are fueled in some sort of environmentally friendly way. Solar panels on the roof? Maybe bike pedaling inside if you want to exercise and provide a small amount of power? I feel like autonomous cars alone will save a ton of energy just by eliminating traffic jams. And cut down on wind resistance since you wouldn't need to keep the traditional design necessarily.
3464,11,131,['bike'],Imagine thousands of public bikes for you to use for short trips around town. Now imagine tens of thousands of people riding these bikes every day
3465,11,131,['bike'],"Improve the bike lanes while simultaneously passing legislation to give huge tax breaks to people who ride bikes. More people will ride bikes, save more money, burn less fuel, and be more in shape."
3466,11,131,['bike'],"In my neighborhood, there's not a lot of space, so I'd have to go with covered bikes of some sort, or one of those neat bike trollys. That would be a neat way to get around and exercise."
3467,11,131,['bike'],"In the downtown area, stations to rent bicycles or even mopeds. Maybe you could have a really cheap membership and present your card at the check out station. Then you would return it at another check out station. It would cut down on how much people use cars. The key would be having enough stations to actually get the bike or moped to make the idea viable."
3468,11,131,['bike'],In the future we invent highly integrated solar bike. Now a days some company was invented solar bike but there is not enough in the future.
3469,11,131,['bike'],"invent solar bikes, cars,etc.,"
3470,11,131,['bike'],"It is not innovative in terms of the whole world, but would be very innovative in my community - bike shares. The area where I live is suburban, so difficult to get enough riders for frequent mass transit. And it's too spread out for just walking. Bike share stands, where subscribers had a code to access bikes from a bike locker, would allow people to commute from place to place (even just to nearby main bus routes) with relative ease."
3471,11,131,['bike'],It would be an electric tram that would ride in the center turning lane of my neighborhood.  It would look like a two-car train that would seat around 40 people.  It would make frequent stops at major intersections and shopping centers in the neighborhood by pulling off to the side in the bike lane. It would have solar panels on the top to help off-set the electricity use.
3472,11,131,['bike'],It would be effective to create a bike club in my neighborhood.  We would choose at least 1 day a week to ride our bikes to work decreasing neighborhood traffic and air pollution.  This bike club would host meetings once a month and reward people who rode the most days to work that month incentivizing people to ride more often.
3473,11,131,['bike'],"It would be great to have a bike share program in my neighborhood. Just have a couple bike lock stations and have the city get us a bunch of bikes, and just use the bikes as we need them and park then when we're done."
3474,11,131,['bike'],"It would be hard to have a viable system in my neighborhood, because this area is so scattered. I think the best idea would be a bikeshare; inexpensive access to bikes would be a great idea! The bigger issue would be making our area bike-friendly. That's the part the requires creativity. We could add extra lanes and then add over/underpasses at intersections to make bikes not just inexpensive, but even more time-effective than driving."
3475,11,131,['bike'],It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.
3476,11,131,['bike'],"Mass transit only routes that expedite buses, bikes and High occupancy vehicles on smaller , yet more direct routes. Toll type control and monitoring. Make a single person in s single car very difficult and punitive"
3477,11,131,['bike'],"Moped rentals. Like bike rentals, these are open access places where someone can rent a small vehicle like a moped or scooter by using their credit card or maybe their ID as their ""deposit"". If they steal the vehicle or damage it, they are billed, but otherwise, must simply have the vehicle back in their stall at the designated time. On-board computers diagnose the vehicles to check for problems or missing parts, and a GPS keeps track of them for asset protection and data collection purposes."
3478,11,131,['bike'],"More bike lanes, or a sky tram to get around, traffic around here is weird."
3479,11,131,['bike'],more bike paths for people to use instead of roads
3480,11,131,['bike'],More bike routes around the city for better and eco-friendly travel.
3481,11,131,['bike'],"most of the people are going office by car . In rainy season if you go by car that is not problem.but scooter using people and children are affected by rain . for that if we fix wind resistant ,water resistant umbrella in the bike . In the handle bar that will be very useful for two wheelers .If we make that kind of vehicle that will become very successful .because of rain only most of the people will go by car . or else they will go by scooter. that will reduce the traffic jam."
3482,11,131,['bike'],My Idea would be to make the alleyways in my city a lot more bike friendly.  Honestly they are very rarely ever used by the city or homeowners so to make them this way would be beneficial for so many others. This would I believe encourage more people to use bicycles since I know I am terrified when riding my bicycle next to extremely lage and fast moving automobile traffic on my cities roads and highways.
3483,11,131,['bike'],"My neighborhood currently has no bike lanes, so I would imagine a system with renewable transportation integrated into the layout. Spaces for bikes, electric car re-charging stations, etc."
3484,11,131,['bike'],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
3485,11,131,['bike'],"My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
3486,11,131,['bike'],"My neighborhood/city/state is ultra conservative- so having bike lanes would be an improvement. Even though this city I live in (Huntsville, AL) has more Ph.D's per capita we are still woefully behind. Since it's such a tech town with so many engineers though...it would have to be something very advanced to get these engineers on board. Like some sort of train driven by magnetic rails."
3487,11,131,['bike'],nicer bike paths so more people would be happy to ride a bike
3488,11,131,['bike'],"Not just in my neighborhood but metro-wide, my city recently established time share bicycles people can rent and ride when they have a short distance to travel. The bikes are all of the same design, having a large sturdy frame painted light blue, three gears (the gear box is inside the rear wheel axle, and LED blinker lights for safety. Necessarily, it's a one-size-fits-all arrangement; there's no way to raise or lower the seat unless you carry your own tools around with you, so if you're a tall person and use one of these bikes you'll be knocking yourself in the chin with your knees."
3489,11,131,['bike'],Now Houston already have public bike stations. These stations allow someone to check out a bike for the day for a small fee. In some other cities someone has the choice to rent a car for the day using a credit card . The cars are eco friendly and cost very little to rent. I'm not talking about CarMax. This service is similar to the same service that is offered to rent bikes here in Houston. I think Houston should think about bringing the idea to the city .
3490,11,131,['bike'],"One day per month (at least) cars should be banned from the roads. Some buses could be allowed to allow for transportation of people who can't walk or bike, but this would be a great way to encourage human-powered transport and allow people to see the fun in this activity without increased danger from car traffic.  This would also be great for the environment."
3491,11,131,['bike'],Open a government-funded shop that lets people buy bikes at a discount. This way more people will have an incentive to ride bikes instead of driving around.
3492,11,131,['bike'],"Our small city is fairly bike/walker friendly, but I think a bike rental kiosk or a bike trading program would be so helpful. I don't own a bike, but I'd like for it to be easier and quicker to get around without driving."
3493,11,131,['bike'],"Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."
3494,11,131,['bike'],Paying a fee for a bike that could be used monthly. There would be multiple stations set up where you could place the bike and switch out for others.
3495,11,131,['bike'],Perhaps a system where you can rent out bicycles or motorbikes to get to where you need to go. You could hold a lot of them in one area and make it easy to check out the bike and then return it later. It would help getting around for people who can't afford a car service to take them around the city but also for people who prefer to be health conscious and also want to save money by biking around the city.
3496,11,131,['bike'],"Public transportation that may have a few bikes on the front that you can borrow/rent. Having the bikes attached to public transportation could help you to go further and maybe get around another city that has other things to offer, other than your own, where you may use the bikes at hand."
3497,11,131,['bike'],"Publicly available bicycles could be stationed at different regions of the town: different parts of the University campus, the downtown square, the region of stores and malls for shopping. This would allow students to be able to rent and use a bike to get around without having to own one and worry about its safety."
3498,11,131,['bike'],"Rent a cycle, a set of motorcycles that you can pay for per hour to take and go to the store or rent for the day for work on warm days. they'd have a wheel lock like the citi bikes in New york so you put your card in and go"
3499,11,131,['bike'],"Rent a scooter in the summer. These would be like the automatic bike rental stations in many cities, only you'd rent rechargable electric scooters. Station would charge them"
3500,11,131,['bike'],Rentable bicycles.  Two or three locations where individuals can rent and return bicycles for a small fee.  The locations probably don't even need someone to watched the bikes if there is some kind of gps locater built in and a cash/credit operated locking mechanism.
3501,11,131,['bike'],Rental electrical bike stations near the bus stops.  You can check out a bike like you were at a library.
3502,11,131,['bike'],Safer bike lanes
3503,11,131,['bike'],"Scooters or bikes for rent put in areas that are too far to walk but for people who can't afford a car, uber, or taxi. You could rent them for a day and return them to the area that evening or keep them for another day's charge like a Redbox sort of system."
3504,11,131,['bike'],Segway automated rentals. Like the bike racks in large public cities. You put down a deposit with a credit card and when you return it you get most of the deposit back.
3505,11,131,['bike'],"Shared bike system - everyone has access to a system of bicycles that are evenly distributed throughout the city via ""bike parking lots."" Punch in a code, get a bike for the day, return it to another station later."
3506,11,131,['bike'],"Similar to the idea of car ride sharing, there could be bike sharing. This already exists on some level, but those bikes are terrible and slow. The bikes could be outfitted with an electric motor, and the motors could be charged via solar panels at the bike stations. This way, people would be more inclined to use them because it would be really easy to get up the hills around here."
3507,11,131,['bike'],"Since where I live gets cold, my idea is to have something like the NYC bike share, but with covered and heated cabs.  Our town isn't too big so you can pick up and drop off like a ZipCar.  The bikes would be electric so you can make it up the hills and to provide heat.  There would be an app to tell you where the nearest bike is and to report anything about it, like it being broken."
3508,11,131,['bike'],Solar powered golf carts. You could have stations kind of like bikes and check them out and return them.
3509,11,131,['bike'],"Some sort of free bicycle rides.  It would work by having you use a credit card (so people cannot steal bicycles) as a deposit.   Here's how it would work.  You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.    If you don't return the bike, it would charge your card aka ask for a retransmission of said packet.  That's all I have for now."
3510,11,131,['bike'],Stalls that allow people to rent and drop off bicycles so they can get around the city without wasting gas and causing pollution. Implant GPS devices inside the bikes so they can't be stolen.
3511,11,131,['bike'],"Subways with shorter runs. NYC is filled with unused tunnels and stations. Get them up and running. Also, allow people who use any sort of wheel-based transport, that's not a bus or car, to use the bike lanes."
3512,11,131,['bike'],"Take the train  to its nearest destination  to your destination.  Get off the train, and rent a bike or scooter to take you to your exact location.  Drop off the bike there, and it's waiting for you for your return trip to the train.  Monthly passes cover all types of transportation and cards are used for bus, train, bike and scooter use."
3513,11,131,['bike'],"Taken from the idea of bike rentals, there should also be motorized scooters available for rental, where you can rent any motorized scooter from a ""station"" and return it to another ""station"" around your area when you are done."
3514,11,131,['bike'],"There are many parts of my area that aren't accessible by foot or bicycle; in order to get from one section of town to another, you have to take a highway, where only motorized vehicles area allowed. This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
3515,11,131,['bike'],"There should be a completely separate bike lane that runs throughout the city, and is plowed even during the winter.  Currently the biking situation isn't too bad, but there are areas where it is hard to feel safe with cars passing by too closely.  During the winter, it is impossible to bike due to snow in the bike lanes"
3516,11,131,['bike'],This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
3517,11,131,['bike'],This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.
3518,11,131,['bike'],Underground walking tunnels (some colleges in cold climates have this) you can bike ride in them too.
3519,11,131,['bike'],Using train and bike will be good transportation mode which reduces cost of living and be good as they wont harm atmosphere.
3520,11,131,['bike'],We should be giving people a tax deduction for doing more walking and/or bike riding to reduce transportation in vehicles.  This applies to my city because everything is so close!
3521,11,131,['bike'],"What if you have self-propelled vehicles (i.e., pedals like a bike) that provide protection against the elements (a roof made of canvass and plastic walls).  These could carry 4-6 people, and someone strong could volunteer to provide the pedal power each day."
3522,12,130,['train'],"A conveyor belt system like the airport set up like the nyc trains would be awesome.  A bit slow going, but cheap, affordable, and it would allow people to be out in the fresh air again."
3523,12,130,['train'],"A form of transportation similar to an airlift, only the seats are at terminals on the ground. You board and they take you to predesignated stops in a direct line, free of traffic. Like a shuttle or train, only on a smaller scale, and ideally seats come in much more frequently, every 30 seconds or so."
3524,12,130,['train'],A golf cart-like train that circles the small town I live in on a regular basis.
3525,12,130,['train'],"A monorail sort of train, raised over the cityscape and nearly silent as it passes overhead.  There would be platforms raised up several stories high, with elevators to reach street level.  The trains would be sleek and shiny silver or white, gleaming in the sun.  The trains would change smoothly and seamlessly from track to track, so that each one can have a different route."
3526,12,130,['train'],A new railway system! We don't have any trains or railways anywhere near the area I live in.
3527,12,130,['train'],A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
3528,12,130,['train'],"A new transportation system  can be something somewhat like a train, but a small train like shuttle, which can take others around the neighborhood, easy, fast and no traffic."
3529,12,130,['train'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
3530,12,130,['train'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be similar to a train line, just on a smaller scale. It would pick people up in a series of pods and deposit them at their place of work for a small fee. This new train type line could also be used in the same way that a bus is, to run errands. The new system would have comfortable couch like chairs and be far more acceptable than the current forms of trnasportation availabe."
3531,12,130,['train'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
3532,12,130,['train'],A online map real time of the buses and trains the area. Buses and trains aren't usually on time and having real on time traffic will show if its a bad bad to drive.
3533,12,130,['train'],A rail system that hangs over the road where trains are suspeended from above and can carry hundreds of people
3534,12,130,['train'],A rail system that is build from the ground up. This would be capable of high speeds typically not able to travel when driving or on another train. This would make work transit much faster.
3535,12,130,['train'],A solar powered train system. That can operate during day and night time.
3536,12,130,['train'],"a solar powered train that gains energy from the sun from the solar panels on the top of the train. it would run from sun up to sun down, to make sure it always has a charge. it would be sort of like a troll, but go as fast as a train."
3537,12,130,['train'],A subway system where you sit in a seat that attaches to a rail as soon as you are seated. You are then transported to your destination. This removes the need to wait for trains like a regular subway.
3538,12,130,['train'],a subway train that becomes a plane
3539,12,130,['train'],A super quick train that would be lightning fast
3540,12,130,['train'],A train that connects Orlando and Tampa for easier travel for better job opportunities for both cities
3541,12,130,['train'],A train that runs hovering above its track on magnetic bearings traveling at near supersonic speeds
3542,12,130,['train'],"A train to the beach.  The beach is about an hour from our town (or three hours with summer traffic), and all traffic to the beach comes through our town due to an important bridge.  We could have a train that leaves from our town, or other stops nearby, and then expresses to the beach.  People would need extra room for luggage - or you could couple it with a luggage delivery system.  It would cut down on time to the beach and the number of cars on the road."
3543,12,130,['train'],"A train would be useful in my city. It would be most useful to travel out to other nearby cities. Traffic is extremely bad on the interstate where I live, and a train would be incredibly useful for traveling to the popular cities surrounding my city."
3544,12,130,['train'],"A tram. We don't really have trams in the Ohio. It's kind of like a smaller version of a train, but very quiet and low energy. It runs on tracks and electricity."
3545,12,130,['train'],"A trolley system would be a great source of transportation, using small trolleys instead of buses.  Another Idea would be a mini bus system that primarily transported people to key areas like the train station or the airport.  A shuttle system."
3546,12,130,['train'],"An above-ground train system. We scrapped a trolley system, and some areas can't support a subway. Above-ground might be useful for us."
3547,12,130,['train'],An AI that tells certain buses or train to slow down at a certain rate to decrease accidents making traffic more efficient.
3548,12,130,['train'],"An alternative transport that would be excellent would be a monorail in my city.  It could be run with electricity, with many train cars, and go along the main north south route.  You could get almost anywhere in quickly and easily if it went along that route."
3549,12,130,['train'],"an app that takes into account both traffic and train congestion, as well as the speeds to walk or bike, to tell you the fastest mode of transport to a destination. For example, train  might typically be quicker to get from A to B, but when trains are spaced 20 minutes apart late at night and there is no traffic, driving/taxi would be faster."
3550,12,130,['train'],"An electric bicycle train. Everyone has their own bike, but they can all hook up to a belt that would transport them at the same speed and direction in a safe manner, maybe even on its own road."
3551,12,130,['train'],"An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
3552,12,130,['train'],An elevated train that ran throughout the city.
3553,12,130,['train'],"An overhead puppy cart system, the same concept as in skii resorts. I live in NYC, and outside of traveling by train, there are no other practicals transportation which avoids traffic. Unlike the the train system, you would be able to make direct routes, with a bonus of great views around the city"
3554,12,130,['train'],"Another idea for a new transportation system would be a magnetic bullet train system, similar to the one they have in Japan. It would be a national rail system built over the old railroads we have now. It would go to every major city in America and would take half the time to do so."
3555,12,130,['train'],"App integrated public & private transport, using location services in smartphones to sync to trains, buses, taxis, Ubers Zipcars etc to streamline travel. Using a global integrated app to pay for any type of transport service"
3556,12,130,['train'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
3557,12,130,['train'],Bicycles with wheels like trains are placed on rails and whoever is going to the market takes this bsicycle and with little bit of paddling the bicycle can reach the destination. There should be distance system where two bicycles should be impossible to collide.
3558,12,130,['train'],build a so many sub way trains
3559,12,130,['train'],"Bullet trains as they have in Japan. We have express trains in NYC, but they still take forever if you want to go downtown. A bullet train that will get you to the boroughs quickly would be fantastic."
3560,12,130,['train'],"CAR IS GOOD FOR FAMILY DRIVE.

SCOOTER IS BEST FOR SINGLE ONE

BUS IS SUITABLE FOR LONG TRAVELLING

TRAIN IS BEST FOR LONG TRAVELLING WITH FAMILY

BICYCLES ARE MAINLY USED FOR EXERCISE AND SCHOOL CHILDREN"
3561,12,130,['train'],"Chicago - Chicago has a great system and phenomenal public transport. As far as transportation though I wish the highways in the city acted like slotted cars, similar to trains in which in every highway entrance there would be a dedicated lane/railway for vehicles to travel at fast speeds like trains. This would reduce traffic and travel times."
3562,12,130,['train'],"Elon Musk's Hyperloop, Hi speed trains traveling in tubes above the city."
3563,12,130,['train'],Environment friendly transportation can be used to avoid global warming . So i prefer Electric trains and electric based vehicles .
3564,12,130,['train'],"Have a transportation system in the city where there is a tunneling system filled miniature train with small passenger capacity. These miniature trains can take people directly to their destination and the best part is that because they are small, there can be a large number of them running underneath the city."
3565,12,130,['train'],"Having some sort of electric train that runs underground, just like the subway system in New York. The city that I currently live in doesn't have that option so having some sort of underground transportation system that runs all around the city constantly would make commuting much better for everyone."
3566,12,130,['train'],High speed rail train
3567,12,130,['train'],"High speed trains to commute into Chicago from various cities throughout northwest Indiana, with sleek train stations that include lots of amenities (coffee shops, dry cleaning, etc.)"
3568,12,130,['train'],"hyper-bullet trains

solar-powered buses"
3569,12,130,['train'],"I can imagine a speedbus being a new form of transportation.  It can have its own lane or tracks, and go as fast or faster than a train."
3570,12,130,['train'],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
3571,12,130,['train'],"I feel like there could be a uber shuttle, sort of like a train system."
3572,12,130,['train'],"I have no problem visualizing a new mode of transportation in my neighborhood. Years ago coal trains ran behind my house and the old gully is still there where the tracks were. Would love to see them back again, but it will never happen."
3573,12,130,['train'],I imagine a railway system that goes through my town and all around the united states. It would be a bullet train like they have in europe that hovers and goes fast. It would be affordable too.
3574,12,130,['train'],"I imagine a train line that rings the entire city, with interstitial lines to service the downtown areas."
3575,12,130,['train'],"I imagine a train system that runs parallel to the street but is separated from it, unlike a streetcar. It could be elevated from the terrain when necessary to cross over obstacles."
3576,12,130,['train'],"I live in a town with a lot of freight trains. A subway system would be nice because it would get us places faster (the town is large in size and spread out over several miles) and be able to bypass the trains, which stop constantly. The subway would run either over the existing trains or under them and run off of cards that were prepaid like the MTAs."
3577,12,130,['train'],"I live in NYC. Travel is not too difficult, with the only real concern being the price of a subway ticket or a taxi ride. With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue. I believe that since the roads and the undergrounds are already full, the only real option is to expand transportation above ground, such as on rails between buildings. This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem."
3578,12,130,['train'],"I picture a brand new train system, going down the main street, with street cars going leading up to the main street.   I would love to see it being a high speed system, paying with your fingerprints.   It would be similar to a credit card."
3579,12,130,['train'],I propose an idea that would rely on strong wire much like telephone wire that would be used to support a small train carriage like car or pod.  I see this as being better than a railway as it would be not as expensive to implement.
3580,12,130,['train'],I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
3581,12,130,['train'],"I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
3582,12,130,['train'],I think a form of public transportation could be an electric type of subway that runs on a non intrusive track layed into the pavment much like a train track. It could be shaped like a normal subway but on the roof space there would be solar panels to generate electricity needed to run. Any remaining power needed could be provided by the tracks.
3583,12,130,['train'],"I think for small towns like mine (20,000) we should have a cross between a trolley and a hoverboard. If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
3584,12,130,['train'],I think there should be personal pods that can ride on train lines and trolley tracks.  These can be bought or rented.  They can follow the train or trolley and then be parked.  It could alleviate a congested train at rush hour.
3585,12,130,['train'],I think we could bring back the streetcar in queens where the subway has low coverage. The streetcar would connect to the subway system which would be entirely rebuilt to accommodate new clean stations with solar panels and zero carbon foot print. This would connect with commuter and regional trains that would operate on an hourly scale.
3586,12,130,['train'],"I think we need to tap into the power of magnets.  We can use solar panels all through the roads, then use them to power magnets on the road.  The vehicles will have oppositely polarized magnets that will be controllable in the car.  I guess it will work like those trains that use magnets, but someone smart will figure out a way to control the magnets independently.  The car battery will power the magnet on the car, and can be shut off immediately once the power is cut in case of emergency."
3587,12,130,['train'],"I want to see the Chicagoland suburbs connected by a train. Most often if they are, it's because they're on the same line going to Chicago, but I'd like to see a system that moves between suburbs that aren't connected on the train line."
3588,12,130,['train'],"I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
3589,12,130,['train'],I would have the Metro system extended further into Virginia to lessen the commute time.  I would also call for train stations that were more accessible and uses solar energy predominantly.
3590,12,130,['train'],I would imagine an electric scooter or hoverboard rental system.  You could use them when going to and from a train station stop and to your final destination.  I imagine a rental system so that you could pick one up at a train or bus station to go your extra distance and return it when you return.  Renting would be a good option if you did not have your own with you or only use it with other public transportation. Bad weather is always an issue using these devices.
3591,12,130,['train'],"I would like an interchangeable form of light rail, in which the train would have several compartments that would be destined for multiple locations. That way you just get on the train, and the train goes to an interchange. At the interchange the compartments are separated (I imagine they are held together by magnets) and grouped together by location. Once all the compartments that are going to the same area are together, the train leaves. It would work like changing trains, except you wouldn't have to go outside."
3592,12,130,['train'],"I would like for a train to be in my neighborhood.   IT would go right down the sides of our main streets.   There is a train currently, but you have to drive far to it.   There should be more trains, not just one or two."
3593,12,130,['train'],"I would like some sort of conveyor belt system or moving walkway (possibly with seats) in my city. It seems like it would be really nice for people, since people walk a lot here. Also, if there was a way to sit while moving, people could get work done and other things, while taking a 'slow ride' down the street (slower than a train, etc, so people can get on/ off while it's moving)."
3594,12,130,['train'],I would like to see a high speed train connect all the major cities in my state as well as the major cities bordering our state.  I envision this high speed train to have minimal stations.  This would eliminate the need for air travel and long road trips.
3595,12,130,['train'],I would like to see a modern underground railway system installed in my neighbourhood. It would be noiseless and very fast. The railway will connect all the neighbourhood together making it easier to move around. The train would be making stops every half hour  to pick up and drop passengers.
3596,12,130,['train'],I would like to see a solar powered train system
3597,12,130,['train'],"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
3598,12,130,['train'],"I would love for there to a more intergrated train system in my city (specifically my neighborhood.) I'd love to be able to hop on a train (or streetcar) and be able to transfer to a larger rail system that would take me to other cities, etc. Something like what european cities have."
3599,12,130,['train'],"I would love individual Segway transporters that would go from the house to the transit station.  They would just fit one person and keep them dry.  Only about 1 mile but just far enough in the rain not to walk.  Once at the transit station, the train takes you directly every 5 minutes into the city."
3600,12,130,['train'],I would love to see a light rail system in my community. I am thinking of above ground trains that would run to the various suburbs and take people to various local stops. These trains should run a regular schedule so people can use them to commute.
3601,12,130,['train'],I would say the biggest way to improve innovating is to have all new construction be made in regards to current public transporation hub and those that cnanot be require them to build a public transportation hub. So all new communities have bus access or train access.
3602,12,130,['train'],"I'd love a system that is like Uber but just for cheap, shared rides home from the train. It'd cost less than a buck for everyone and operate as a shuttle for people that live within 5 mins of the train."
3603,12,130,['train'],In my neighborhood i imagine a trolley on solar powered magnetic train tracks. This keeps the trolley moving at all times but keeps anyone from getting hurt like children.
3604,12,130,['train'],"In the future, self driving cabs can be summoned via mobile phone, to pick up the driver and take them to a particular destination via a touchscreen or other similar interface located inside the vehicle.  Some difficulty may occur if the passenger is unsure of the address of his or her destination, but a trained attendant can be called to determine the location for the passenger."
3605,12,130,['train'],Instead of buses or trains that come at specific times there would be a looped track with chairs that circles the city constantly there would never be a wait as it would be running constantly.
3606,12,130,['train'],"It would be a railway but instead of a train, it has small, separate cars that only fit one individual for their own convenience and comfort. The car would be a tall, rectangular box shape with a seat, kind of like a car seat inside."
3607,12,130,['train'],"It would be a super fast train system. It would be so fast that my husband could get to his job, which is ten miles away in 5 minutes. It would be super popular and efficient. Everyone from business people to house wifes would want to use it."
3608,12,130,['train'],It would be an electric tram that would ride in the center turning lane of my neighborhood.  It would look like a two-car train that would seat around 40 people.  It would make frequent stops at major intersections and shopping centers in the neighborhood by pulling off to the side in the bike lane. It would have solar panels on the top to help off-set the electricity use.
3609,12,130,['train'],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
3610,12,130,['train'],"It would be great for our city to offer more access to the rails.  We could use an updated rail system that would make traveling to our larger cities in the state faster, more available, and yet still affordable.  It could bring more people to live in our city if they could travel fast to the big city and help grow our town here.  Our town is terribly depressed and I think that having a high-speed train or just general more options to travel through it would bring a massive amount of revenue into the city."
3611,12,130,['train'],It would be like a super fast tram or train so the people in my neighborhood could get to run errands without their cars. We could have stops at the entrances to the neighborhood and the tracks could just run down the street.
3612,12,130,['train'],It's an elevated covered roadway somewhat similar to elevated train tracks but it's for bicycles and it has a bunch of fans to provide an artificial tailwind to provide a speed comparable to cars in a congested urban setting.
3613,12,130,['train'],"Lets try non mechanical modes of transportation instead we either walk or ride an animal from place to place.  The animal can be any type such as elephant, horse, donkey, camel, and maybe you can train something a bit faster."
3614,12,130,['train'],Moving sidewalks would help people get to the train station more smoothly.
3615,12,130,['train'],"My city would benefit from an elevated and enclosed train line. Regional rail is the preferred choice for many commuters but is unreliable and frustrating due to weather and traffic related delays. Though the infrastructure investment would be great, we are in need of an overhaul anyway and should improve the current system."
3616,12,130,['train'],"My idea for public transportation would include an underground rail system powered by magnets. Because of the varied climate as well as prevalence natural disasters in my area, having the system underground seems like the best idea. The train would stop a lot more often than normal trains; At the end of every street at least. It would have a separate exit system in order to not lose quite as much time loading and unloading passengers."
3617,12,130,['train'],"My idea is a combination of self driving cars, rideshare and a train. Commuters would pay for a ticket and a line of connected self driving cars would take commuters going the same route/direction to a certain dropoff point, like a train does. Then when the string of cars reaches the stop point, each passenger can enter their desired destination into the touchpad screen in the car and they would be driven to their individual destinations. The self driving cars would break off individually from the train to take these passengers, then they'd return on their own to the ""train station"" to go pick up more passengers."
3618,12,130,['train'],"My idea would be a people mover, basically like a combination of a elevator and a train. It would be a box people stand in and it glides on a track really quickly. They would look like long boxes and hang from long lines that steer it and provide power. Their main concern would be to get many people somewhere extremely fast and efficiently, not really for comfort."
3619,12,130,['train'],"My neighborhood added an above ground train similar to the ""L"" in Chicago.  It runs along the highways bringing people downtown from the suburbs.  It does a few loops downtown and runs near the major companies to get people to work.  It is much cheaper and more convenient than driving downtown and parking."
3620,12,130,['train'],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
3621,12,130,['train'],"My neighborhood/city/state is ultra conservative- so having bike lanes would be an improvement. Even though this city I live in (Huntsville, AL) has more Ph.D's per capita we are still woefully behind. Since it's such a tech town with so many engineers though...it would have to be something very advanced to get these engineers on board. Like some sort of train driven by magnetic rails."
3622,12,130,['train'],"New idea, trains that fly.  This would combine two existing means of transportation into one futuristic flight fantasy! A train would travel as usual and then be picked up by a plane.  This way a train car could travel faster and then be dropped back off on its final stop by the plane."
3623,12,130,['train'],"Off the ground magnetic rails have high speed autonomous trains that anyone can use, and it gets you to areas much faster than can now be done."
3624,12,130,['train'],"Our City has no nearby neighbors. Any future ideas are going to require a rail system, preferably something fast like japanese trains. Maglev technology which will allow faster travel from coastal towns and cities to the capital."
3625,12,130,['train'],our city is metro .population is a big problem there and traffic too .large no of people use public transport like trains and buses but also use scooter in large nos as its easy to go to places when there is lot of traffic on rads to avoid jams.

3641,12,130,['train'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."

It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."

Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available.

3698,13,126,['transport'],"I imagine a series of widening arches or loops of roadway and of several different sizes to accompany different types of pubic transport. Cars wouldn't be allowed in the city but stored at various exit point garages which would be provided by the city. Small roads would have small shuttles, large roads would have large fast moving shuttles that span the city. Independently, smaller walkways would be used for pedestrians and cyclists (and other man powered or tiny engine machines.) Larger walkways could become festival street fair type roads that are common in places like Greece."

No more worrying about going up and down the crazy hills, especially in the winter. Booyah!"
3701,13,126,['transport'],"I live in an area where there are a lot of senior citizens so driving can sometimes be scary, and I think this city would greatly benefit from public transportation. However, I think something that would benefit the environment would be the most helpful, so I think pushcarts would be a lot of fun, or even horse drawn carriages.

3703,13,126,['transport'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
3704,13,126,['transport'],"I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
3705,13,126,['transport'],"I think a drone transport system that would carry people, good and other items would be a great service.  An even better idea is if was peer run, meaning run by people in your neighborhood, and all the profits would be split."

3709,13,126,['transport'],I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.

3711,13,126,['transport'],"I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
3712,13,126,['transport'],I would like there to be a fast speed rail such as in Japan or Germany. I picture it being accurate time-wise and capable of transporting people over great distances. I would prefer it to a bus situation.

If we had a shuttle system that specifically transported people from a central point to the four primary destinations it would incredibly reduce the use of fossil fuels, traffic, and accidents in the area."
3715,13,126,['transport'],"I'd use apps and social media so I know the times of all transport.  If it's late, I don't want to hang out too long. An app would pick up my location and show the times of the buses or street car. I could set it to warn me too."
3716,13,126,['transport'],"I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
3717,13,126,['transport'],It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
3718,13,126,['transport'],It would be an app that allows people to call in helicopters to their location. It would let them call a helicopter to where they live and be transported from there.
3719,13,126,['transport'],"It would replace everything: roads, sideways, buses, etc. It would be electric powered. Definitely automated. You should be able to transport to wherever you want to go without lifting a finger.

3726,13,126,['transport'],"My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on.

There is also the option of seatbelts or straps that can prevent the riders from falling out or off. In the back of the scooter object would be a large area where personal baggage and things can be kept and it automatically locks once enough passengers are aboard. This area is kept locked by the operator of the scooter ride. On each side of the edges of the scooter ride are places for phones and other devices to be plugged in. The scooter ride would be plugged in to keep it charged up and there would be solar panels on the back to make sure that the ride can be energized and charged for a moment's notice.

In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."

3826,14,124,['vehicle'],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town.

3827,14,124,['vehicle'],"I live on an army base. There are hundreds of vehicles that just sit around and collect rust, and it would be wonderful if the military could find some way to rent these vehicles out to the public.

3828,14,124,['vehicle'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
3829,14,124,['vehicle'],I think a van that picks people up when the driver knows that person needs a ride because it is dark or they don't have a vehicle would be nice.

3830,14,124,['vehicle'],"I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it. I don't think that vehicle ownership will be nearly as widespread as it is these days, as driverless cars will be far safer."
3831,14,124,['vehicle'],"I think freelance carpooling would be a great idea. Vehicle owner can at any time turn themselves into a taxi service.

3833,14,124,['vehicle'],"I think we need to tap into the power of magnets.  We can use solar panels all through the roads, then use them to power magnets on the road.  The vehicles will have oppositely polarized magnets that will be controllable in the car.  I guess it will work like those trains that use magnets, but someone smart will figure out a way to control the magnets independently.  The car battery will power the magnet on the car, and can be shut off immediately once the power is cut in case of emergency."

People around here are constantly complaining about weather conditions and global warming and I think my method could bring a lot of people together and solve a lot of the commuting problems around here. There are just so many cars and it seems there is an average of just 1.5 people per vehicle. It is rather said. I really would want to push toward the people mover rail systems."
3835,14,124,['vehicle'],"I would like to see a public transportation system, funded by the government and running non-stop.  Possibly employing people in an uber style privately owned vehicle service.  Or some car pool ideas."
3836,14,124,['vehicle'],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
3837,14,124,['vehicle'],I would like to see a system that would be quicker for pickups and drop offs. This would mean vehicles similar to busses but smaller and more efficient.
3838,14,124,['vehicle'],"I'd like to see vehicles that will fly, take up little space on the ground, go up and down more like a helicopter so large parking runways are not needed. These cars would almost fly themselves and need little direction other than where they're going."
3839,14,124,['vehicle'],"I'd love to see an all-electric option for carpooling at the school where I work. There are 5 families whose children/adults work or attend school at the same place, and we live on the same street. We are about 10 miles from school. We could all ride to school together, charge the vehicle while we are at school, and ride home together."
3840,14,124,['vehicle'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
3841,14,124,['vehicle'],"In the future, self driving cabs can be summoned via mobile phone, to pick up the driver and take them to a particular destination via a touchscreen or other similar interface located inside the vehicle.  Some difficulty may occur if the passenger is unsure of the address of his or her destination, but a trained attendant can be called to determine the location for the passenger."
3842,14,124,['vehicle'],"In the future, there will be electric powered vehicle system. There will be transportation centers with different sized vehicles for rent for a small fee. The vehicles will range in size from one person scooters to six person vehicles. They will be rented on an hourly basis."
3843,14,124,['vehicle'],"In the interest of reducing traffic and accidents, a new series of self-driving only roads and lanes are opened.  On these roads, ONLY self driving cars are authorized to drive, and on them there are no speed limits (not that the self-driving cars would be going that much faster than normal). Unfettered by the chaos of common roads and the limitations of human judgement, these exclusively self-driving vehicle areas allow the navigational AIs to coordinate for an optimally fast and efficient journey."
3844,14,124,['vehicle'],"It would be better if the government will create a new transpo scheme wherein there will be a separate lane for buses, a separate late wherein it is closed for every other vehicle and there are stations for the customers just like in train/subway system, card system will be used in the stations estimated time of the next bus arrival shown on screen and it can also be checked through a mobile app"
3845,14,124,['vehicle'],"It would be great if we had raised, walkable paths all throughout my neighborhood. They would be similar to bridges, only not as high and not as wide, that way people could walk or run for exercise and not worry about being struck by vehicles."
3846,14,124,['vehicle'],It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.
3847,14,124,['vehicle'],"Larger Vehicles for apps like Uber that set up car pool for large amounts of people that are going to the same area. For example in Austin, Texas many people enjoy 6th straight but struggle to find parking. If apps like uber could set up their own busses or larger vehicles for transportation to places like 6th street or concerts/ sports arenas it would be much more efficient than a bus that makes regular stops."
3848,14,124,['vehicle'],"Mass transit only routes that expedite buses, bikes and High occupancy vehicles on smaller , yet more direct routes. Toll type control and monitoring. Make a single person in s single car very difficult and punitive"
3849,14,124,['vehicle'],"Moped rentals. Like bike rentals, these are open access places where someone can rent a small vehicle like a moped or scooter by using their credit card or maybe their ID as their ""deposit"". If they steal the vehicle or damage it, they are billed, but otherwise, must simply have the vehicle back in their stall at the designated time. On-board computers diagnose the vehicles to check for problems or missing parts, and a GPS keeps track of them for asset protection and data collection purposes."
3850,14,124,['vehicle'],"most of the people are going office by car . In rainy season if you go by car that is not problem.but scooter using people and children are affected by rain . for that if we fix wind resistant ,water resistant umbrella in the bike . In the handle bar that will be very useful for two wheelers .If we make that kind of vehicle that will become very successful .because of rain only most of the people will go by car . or else they will go by scooter. that will reduce the traffic jam."
3851,14,124,['vehicle'],"My idea alternative transportation in the neighborhood would be horseback. There would be nice safe wide equestrian trails throughout allowing you to visit neighbors, go to the convenience or grocery store which would have hitching posts. Motorized vehicles would be limited to passenger cars/trucks."
3852,14,124,['vehicle'],"My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."
3853,14,124,['vehicle'],My idea is to have a service like zipcar in which someone rents the use of a car by paying a monthly fee except that it would be mopeds for individuals or something larger like a pick up truck.  Just more options than a small smart car.  I used to live in Tokyo and driving a car there was awful but not something like a moped or motorcycle because they could ride in between the cars.  A larger vehicle like a pickup truck would be good for people who need to rent something to haul furniture or something like that but don't want to drive all the way to a car rental place or Lowe's to get the truck.  Everything would be rentable using an app and the cars would feature opening the doors and starting the cars through the app itself.
3854,14,124,['vehicle'],My idea is to use special parking lots for energy efficient vehicles in order to give incentive to the use of cleaner energy. These parking lots could be in the more crowded city areas and you'd need a special pass or something after having your vehicle cleared.
3855,14,124,['vehicle'],"My mode of alternative transportation would include cars, buses, and trams running on solar energy in roadways. I'm unsure how it would work exactly, but if we could harness the power of the sun and build vehicles that have the panels either on them or in the tires it could remove the use of fossil fuels."
3856,14,124,['vehicle'],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
3857,14,124,['vehicle'],Obviously self driving cars are going to be the norm in 10 years.  It's basically just a standard vehicle with additional software and mechanical components that let it interact with the road and other vehicles without user input.  You'll be able to just hop in and be taken to wherever you need to go that has a road to it while you relax.
3858,14,124,['vehicle'],"One person cars. That's right. A one seated car that allows one individual to have complete control. What is this solving you may ask. Why create a bigger vehicle for and individuals who has no use for it. Just a one door car that has a seat, a gear shift and a steering wheel. There are still creature comforts that are compact and accessible for each individual. Best part, they are one fifth of the price."
3859,14,124,['vehicle'],"One thing I would love to see in my local area is rent able electric scooters. They would be good for the environment, easy to maintain, and reduce traffic in terms of larger vehicles on the road."
3860,14,124,['vehicle'],"Our new transportation system would involve golf carts.  Several roads would be designated as golf-cart-only areas and include parking.  New paths could be created because they take up less space than normal roads and even designated lanes on existing roads could be defined to use existing infrastructure.  The environment would be healthier with less pollutants, crowding would be less due to smaller size vehicles, and it would even encourage healthier lifestyles out in the air and sunshine."
3861,14,124,['vehicle'],"Pedestrians and cyclists  will develop sensing, intent recognition, and vehicle control  itsâ€™ knowledge, skills and experience to the Safe  vulnerable road users"
3862,14,124,['vehicle'],peer to peer sharing of vehicles within a neighborhood. there is accountability with keeping the vehicles clean since it is shared within a community.
3863,14,124,['vehicle'],"People not owning private vehicles, but could summon a vehicle for use though a computer or smartphone to their location. The vehicle would take them where they need to go. All of the vehicles would be electrical and green friendly. The vehicle might take you to another form of transportation if the software determined that a train would be more appropriate."
3864,14,124,['vehicle'],Personal one seater vehicles for work purposes.
3865,14,124,['vehicle'],Picture a vehicle of transport that almost resembles a giant scooter. But the thing is that more than a few people can ride it at a time and it can be programmed to go to the destination that you need. There is also the option of seatbelts or straps that can prevent the riders from falling out or off. In the back of the scooter object would be a large area where personal baggage and things can be kept and it automatically locks once enough passengers are aboard. This area is kept locked by the operator of the scooter ride. On each side of the edges of the scooter ride are places for phones and other devices to be plugged in. The scooter ride would be plugged in to keep it charged up and there would be solar panels on the back to make sure that the ride can be energized and charged for a moment's notice.
3866,14,124,['vehicle'],"Pollution is becoming a real problem in my area. The local government should provide tax incentives for people who adopt clean energy vehicles. The high upfront cost of these vehicles make the cost prohibitive to many, but by creating tax incentives, the local government would be able to offset some of that cost."
3867,14,124,['vehicle'],"Public transportation would be ran on hybrid engines, that would be better for emissions, and far more fuel efficient. Future transportation would be far more fuel efficient that runs on alternate forms of power, rather than fossil fuels such as gasoline. These new vehicles would rely less on the oil resource and be cleaner, and far more efficient than before."
3868,14,124,['vehicle'],Renewable energy vehicle such as an electrical bus or trolley. An Uber like service that uses low emissions vehicles or electrical ones.
3869,14,124,['vehicle'],"Self driving cars that you can schedule to arrive with an app on your smartphone. It will pick you up and take you anywhere, and it's all automated. No dealing with drivers or people. It runs efficiently and clean with electric vehicles."
3870,14,124,['vehicle'],Self-driving cars will be the near future vehicle which can transport people to locations that is much safer for drivers and fellow passengers.
3871,14,124,['vehicle'],Self-driving vehicles will be linked into a computerized grid that will adjust traffic flow and density to most efficiently transport people from point A to B.
3872,14,124,['vehicle'],"Six different modes of powered vehicles; some motorized, some human powered. Some are single person transports, others are large, mass transit."
3873,14,124,['vehicle'],Small enclosed golf cart sized vehicle. Gas powered but powerful enough to not get suck in mud puddles. Top sleep of 45 mph. Looks much more like a mini hummer.
3874,14,124,['vehicle'],Solar powered roads and highways. We could install solar panels on the concrete and find some way to cover it so panels don't get destroyed. That way any vehicle can use the energy to power itself and travel as it passes on the road. The economy as well as the average person would save a ton of money. The change on the environment would also be beneficial.
3875,14,124,['vehicle'],"Something like a bus stop, however you would be picked up and dropped off by someone who might be passing through, other drivers, company vehicles (like UPS trucks), etc."
3876,14,124,['vehicle'],"The current highway infa structure in this country is outdated and in disrepair. We should reinvest in our bridges and highways and retrofit them with sensors to aid in the development of autonomous vehicles. Thus reducing gridlock, emissions, accidents, and travel times."
3877,14,124,['vehicle'],"The future transportation system in me neighborhood is going to consist of driverless vehicles that hover and travel with the help of magnetism. The vehicles have built in solar panels that operate throughout the city 24/7. These vehicles all have routines they follow everyday so people just have to transfer according to where they want to go. On the other hand, if people want to own their own vehicle then it is possible. They can travel where ever they want to and all they have to do is to recharge their solar battery in the sunlight."
3878,14,124,['vehicle'],"The future transportation system in my neighborhood is called air cars. They were created in an effort to reduce carbon footprints and try to save our planet. These vehicles are much more lighter than regular cars and can be upgraded to fly. The best thing about these cars is that they operate solely on air. What is even better is that there is a filter that intakes air and cleans it by trapping dirty air in a compartment only able to be removed by manufacturers. This is our last ditch effort to save the Earth, so buy a Clean Car."
3879,14,124,['vehicle'],"The neighborhood I live in has alley ways behind our properties. So when getting kids to school in our town, we could have some sort of trolley or train-like vehicle that could go up and down the alleys picking up the kids. This would be quick and efficient and the kids would want to go to school because it would be fun and exciting."
3880,14,124,['vehicle'],The vehicle run in the solar power.
3881,14,124,['vehicle'],"There are many parts of my area that aren't accessible by foot or bicycle; in order to get from one section of town to another, you have to take a highway, where only motorized vehicles area allowed. This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
3882,14,124,['vehicle'],There are two different modes of transportation within my city. The first one is a car. They usually have four doors on the left and right sides of them that open outwardly. There are four wheels and windows towards the top of the vehicle for viewing. The steering gear is located in the front seat on the left hand side and is controlled by the driver.
3883,14,124,['vehicle'],"This idea is aimed to put a copter' in your garage! Imagine instead of opening your garage to a car, instead theres a small personal helicopter inside.  These small, one or two person max flying vehicles would be ideal for keeping roadways clear!"
3884,14,124,['vehicle'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
3885,14,124,['vehicle'],This is a hybrid airship. Technology has developed that allows these vehicles to be more compact and use hydrogen lift cells safely. There are dozens of air ferries lifting people quietly into the air and to major cities all across America. The carbon footprint of the consumer aviation industry is drastically reduced. The noise pollution of traditional airports is all but gone. The hybrid airship is the vehicle of choice in terms of transportation.
3886,14,124,['vehicle'],"This is about a single user system. It is similar to a bicycle. But it's does not run on road. It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable. We take it from home or rent from government."
3887,14,124,['vehicle'],"This system would be made up of a continuous stream of drivers of small vehicles.  The vehicles might be three-wheelers or some other form of small, motorized vehicles.  Besides the driver, the vehicles would only have space for two other occupants.  The vehicles would continue on the same busy stretch of road.  In other words, they would be on a fixed path.  Also, there would be a large number of these vehicles, a constant stream, so the passenger would never have to wait longer than a minute or two.  The passengers would have prepaid for the service, so there would be no need to exchange money with the driver."
3888,14,124,['vehicle'],This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
3889,14,124,['vehicle'],This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.
3890,14,124,['vehicle'],transportation vehicles
3891,14,124,['vehicle'],Using driver-less vehicles as a taxi service around town by allowing residents to reserve a ride at any time by using the town's website.
3892,14,124,['vehicle'],"Vehicles that circle around a block, which allow for passengers to jump right on.  Not necessarily a bus."
3893,14,124,['vehicle'],"vehicles that life themselves to allow ""stacking"" of cars, this would reduce traffic by half."
3894,14,124,['vehicle'],We have lots of busses that are never full. Phase them out in favor of smaller vehicles that are electric or hybrid.
3895,14,124,['vehicle'],we introduce highly integrated solar vehicles.
3896,14,124,['vehicle'],we introduce solar vehicles.
3897,14,124,['vehicle'],"we need dedicated motorcycle streets, preferably underground, i live in a very populated city (not LA status but still very urban) and ive often thought that a small underground road system built primarily for two wheeled street vehicles would not only cut down on traffic but the pollotuion created could them be trapped and prevented from being released into the atmosphere... it would cause motorcycle sales to skyrocket and there by provide another added economic benefit."
3898,14,124,['vehicle'],We should be giving people a tax deduction for doing more walking and/or bike riding to reduce transportation in vehicles.  This applies to my city because everything is so close!
3899,14,124,['vehicle'],"What if you have self-propelled vehicles (i.e., pedals like a bike) that provide protection against the elements (a roof made of canvass and plastic walls).  These could carry 4-6 people, and someone strong could volunteer to provide the pedal power each day."
3900,14,124,['vehicle'],When I imagine future transportation in my neighborhood I visualize the vehicles of today with more advanced technology. I image that the vehicles will be able to drive themselves and all that is needed is for a person to input their destination and sit back. I think that the interior of the vehicles will be the biggest changes because these vehicles will allow people to sit back and relax. I think that the interior will be comfortable seats and have TVs to pass the time. Overall I imagine future transportation being someone similar to today but with less demand on people.
3901,14,124,['vehicle'],"We have a lot of old and unused train tracks in my town, so I like to create some kind of manually powered train type vehicle that would each fit several people and could be propelled forward either manually for free or with power for a fee."
3902,15,114,['service'],A bicycle rickshaw service.
3903,15,114,['service'],A bicycle service for when you are not in a hurry.
3904,15,114,['service'],A bicycle taxi service
3905,15,114,['service'],"A bike rental service that lest customers rent bikes for reasonable rates daily or weekly, with pick up and return spots very conveniently located around the city"
3906,15,114,['service'],"A central hub for a ridesharing service that provides cars for small groups to take to neighboring towns. I live in a rural area, a few minutes from a very small village. The nearest SMALL city is about 30 minutes away, and the nearest decent sized city is almost an hour away. A ridesharing service would make accessing these places much easier, and if the company provided the car (for a fee, of course), those without vehicles could be serviced."
3907,15,114,['service'],A civilian shuttle service that is cheaper when compared to Uber or Lyft that has a specific destination (i.e. the airport or certain resort stops). It would hold around 40 passengers and you'd have to call it in advance as if scheduling an appointment. Anyone can use it and seniors and disabled would receive discounts.
3908,15,114,['service'],A crowd-sourced bus stop app. Instead of having fixed bus stops throughout the city. People through a smart phone app request a bus to stop at a certain locations. This would provide information to the bus service company in improving the locations and times of where service is needed the most.
3909,15,114,['service'],"A free taxi service for students, especially for nights so that students can get back safely. Instead of a car or a big bus, it could be a small bus so that it can fit enough people, but not use too much gas."
3910,15,114,['service'],"A group carpooling smartphone app that allows people in apartment complexes or housing areas to visualize a profile of others in the area that are traveling to a nearby destination. Participants can communicate over the app, and background check and everything is done before being certified to use the service. People can post looking for ride notes, or say that they are traveling to a specific area and looking for passengers to ride in order to split costs."
3911,15,114,['service'],A hover board sharing service. Like a car rental but with hover boards. Must be located near bike paths.
3912,15,114,['service'],"A local-government sponsored ridesharing service, much like Uber. However, the proprietors will be the local government, so the commissions from rides will be reinvested into the local community."
3913,15,114,['service'],"A new taxi service that uses mopeds rather than cars. It's something used quite frequently in other countries (such as Brazil). You would be able to call for assistance or simply stop them off the side of the road (just like a taxi, obviously)."
3914,15,114,['service'],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
3915,15,114,['service'],A pedi cab service similar to Uber. People would sign up to drive people around on their bicycles. It's a small neighborhood and could easily be done. The call service could have a phone app and website to make it easier to schedule pick ups.
3916,15,114,['service'],A pick up service that allows you to rack up points for free future pick ups
3917,15,114,['service'],A separate lane for Ride-Share drivers.  This way the ride-sharing service can cut down on time and money.
3918,15,114,['service'],a service in which you get picked up by a car and earn points you can redeem for free rides
3919,15,114,['service'],A service where you can easily pick up a ride to ublic transportation. many people live in areas where public transportation is just slighlty out of reach. this would allow people to get there in an easy an inexpensive manner.
3920,15,114,['service'],A service where you sit in a heated or air conditioned glass bubble and get towed around by an automated driver using drone technology.
3921,15,114,['service'],A system like Uber where people can collaborate and find others who have extra space in their car for a sort of taxi/carpool service.
3922,15,114,['service'],"A system of neighborhood drivers who form a cooperative and use their own vehicles to provide transportation services. We live in a community of 1875 people in a rural area, it may not be practical, but it is doable."
3923,15,114,['service'],A taxi service where self-driving cars can be dispatched to a client which then drive the client to their destination and then return to HQ.
3924,15,114,['service'],A type of uber service that transports more than a car of people.
3925,15,114,['service'],A uber type service on the intercoastal in Florida
3926,15,114,['service'],"An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
3927,15,114,['service'],"An autonomous car service. This would require the building and investing into self driving cars. You would have a mobile app you can call and request a car and one is immediately dispatched to you. Using your phone you tell it where you want to go. It navigates there. Best of all, this would be free - or very cheap."
3928,15,114,['service'],"An underground Seqway track which will take a while to build but will be extremely beneficial. There are no turns as underground paths are completely straight. Recharger stations are at every mile or two. There are practically no intersections or traffic lights except at major hubs, which are few and far between. Delivery services such as mail and UPS are a major component of this transportation system, which will make them faster and clear up traffic on major roads."
3929,15,114,['service'],"App integrated public & private transport, using location services in smartphones to sync to trains, buses, taxis, Ubers Zipcars etc to streamline travel. Using a global integrated app to pay for any type of transport service"
3930,15,114,['service'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
3931,15,114,['service'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."

3934,15,114,['service'],"Automated taxi service. Would have several dispatch stations in key areas of city. Person could call for a ride from an app on their phone and it would send a car to them. The software could calculate rate for the trip and make you pay before as a confirmation before sending a car out. Car could then drive customer to said destination.  Self driveable cars that could provide a much better service than the often RUDE cab drivers could provide. Plus, I trust a robot way more than some of these morons driving!"
3935,15,114,['service'],"Bus lines that run on algorythms generated by apps on citizens' phones in order to insure adequate service and reduce waste.  In off hours, users can ""ping"" the authority before they reach the stop they expect to be picked up at."

before. Beautiful, walkable town squares combine residential, retail, office, recreation and public

transportation features to make community living easy. New bus services and light rail extensions

improve mobility and ease congestion. Even the smallest adjustments, like widening sidewalks and

adding bikeways, can provide dramatic impact and value."

3943,15,114,['service'],"How about a deluxe line of buses. You have to pay 150 or above a month for a pass, but these run better routes, and they actually run on time. The regular monthly bus pass is 65, but the service is terrible. On this new route, absolutely no discounts, no half fares, no free rides. Always have security on the bus to get rid of the riff raff. This new deluxe bus wouldn't even share stops with the regular bus route."
3944,15,114,['service'],"How about color coded cars that only service a particular area for a flat rate. As the car takes a passenger to desired location within that particular area, if another person flags that same colored car, that person can hop in and share the ride. After all, the drop off points will be in the same general area and the rate is flat."
3945,15,114,['service'],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.

3947,15,114,['service'],"i live in a somewhat smaller town in rural virginia. everything is super accessible and easy to get to. our town is gold cart friendly. my idea would be a cab service, but with golf carts. it would be a super fun way to help people get from point A to point B. it would also encourage safer driving."
3948,15,114,['service'],I live in a town right on the ocean and there are many canals here. I think a canoe taxi service would be really convenient and fun. It wouldn't get people to their desired locations super fast but it would allow people to travel leisurely and enjoy the scenery along the way. It would also be really healthy for the people driving the canoes and help them to stay fit.
3949,15,114,['service'],"I live in a very rural area that doesn't get bus service because of low population. My idea would be a bus service that runs on the same premise as a taxi service... when someone in the area would need a ride, the bus would alter its route to pick up a passenger. That way, the remote area could be serviced by mass transit, yet wouldn't have to waste fuel or money driving to the remote area all of the time. These requests could be put in via phone, web portal, or e-mail."
3950,15,114,['service'],"I propose a motorcyle service that goes and fetches small items on demand (diapers, over the counter medicines, dinner supplies). I think this would be very useful for senior citizens and families with young children or single people who dont feel well."
3951,15,114,['service'],"I see self driving cars for personal transportation. There will be several sizes available depending on the number of passengers. There will be cars for a single passenger and buses for large groups. You will pay by mile as well as a monthly fee to access the service. Almost all deliveries will be performed by drone. The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
3952,15,114,['service'],"I see the potential for self-driving cars to replace taxi services. People would call an automated line, or perhaps interact with a site/app on their computers/phones, to schedule to be picked up by the service. Meanwhile, a network that keeps track of all self-driving cars in its region would figure out which car was closest or would have to deviate the least to pick up the passenger within 5-10 minutes of being hailed. These cars could be compartmentalized to hold four or six passengers without individuals having to worry about undesired contact with the other passengers. The cars could run on electricity and the network would consider battery life with regards to planning routes and destinations."
3953,15,114,['service'],"I think a drone transport system that would carry people, good and other items would be a great service.  An even better idea is if was peer run, meaning run by people in your neighborhood, and all the profits would be split."
3954,15,114,['service'],"I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it. I don't think that vehicle ownership will be nearly as widespread as it is these days, as driverless cars will be far safer."
3955,15,114,['service'],"I think freelance carpooling would be a great idea. Vehicle owner can at any time turn themselves into a taxi service. The service can be run through a phone app, workers can set their own hours and rates. This would cut down on pollution, eliminate unnecessary vehicles on the road, and boost the economy overall."
3956,15,114,['service'],"I think there should be free neighborhood circulators that stop at significant shopping centers, landmarks, or services, that run throughout the day. I think they should be brightly colored bus-like vehicles."
3957,15,114,['service'],I think we need a greener alternative to the uber/lyft types of services. Perhaps an app that connects you to bike and rickshaw drivers. Like an uber or lyft for rickshaws. I took a cycle rickshaw after a music festival this summer and it was great. Took a while to get to the destination but it felt really cool to get a ride from a biker.
3958,15,114,['service'],I would enjoy having a limousine service in the neighborhood. That would be a safe and comfortable mode of transportation.

The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
3968,15,114,['service'],I'd like to see the combination of a food truck and a taxi. This way you could grab a fresh made bite to eat while on your way to the destination. There would be a seating area in the front and a small kitchen with a service window in the back. This bus could serve hot and cold sandwiches and maybe drinkable soup in cups with lids to prevent spills. Now all you have to do is hail a cab. Forget finding something to eat then looking for the cab. The food can be prepared for you onboard.

It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental.

3981,15,114,['service'],My idea is to have a service like zipcar in which someone rents the use of a car by paying a monthly fee except that it would be mopeds for individuals or something larger like a pick up truck.  Just more options than a small smart car.  I used to live in Tokyo and driving a car there was awful but not something like a moped or motorcycle because they could ride in between the cars.  A larger vehicle like a pickup truck would be good for people who need to rent something to haul furniture or something like that but don't want to drive all the way to a car rental place or Lowe's to get the truck.  Everything would be rentable using an app and the cars would feature opening the doors and starting the cars through the app itself.
3982,15,114,['service'],Now Houston already have public bike stations. These stations allow someone to check out a bike for the day for a small fee. In some other cities someone has the choice to rent a car for the day using a credit card . The cars are eco friendly and cost very little to rent. I'm not talking about CarMax. This service is similar to the same service that is offered to rent bikes here in Houston. I think Houston should think about bringing the idea to the city .
3983,15,114,['service'],Perhaps a system where you can rent out bicycles or motorbikes to get to where you need to go. You could hold a lot of them in one area and make it easy to check out the bike and then return it later. It would help getting around for people who can't afford a car service to take them around the city but also for people who prefer to be health conscious and also want to save money by biking around the city.

We're supposed to get a foot of snow in a week and I really don't want to have to deal with driving in it, worrying about getting stuck. We should have a fleet of snowmobile drivers to help get people to and from work. Cut down on accidents and stress."
3993,15,114,['service'],"Some sort of free bicycle rides.  It would work by having you use a credit card (so people cannot steal bicycles) as a deposit.   Here's how it would work.  You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.    If you don't return the bike, it would charge your card aka ask for a retransmission of said packet.  That's all I have for now."
3994,15,114,['service'],"Something like Uber or Lyft, but for getting kids to school. This way it's on an as needed basis rather than paying a flat fee for bus service that may not always be used for one reason or another. Especially when the child is staying late for practice or what not."
3995,15,114,['service'],"The city could do a partial co pay or cheap taxi or destination bus service. as in you meet the bus at a specific pick up place but then you tell the address you want, no designated stop."
3996,15,114,['service'],"The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
3997,15,114,['service'],"The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
3998,15,114,['service'],"There should be paid service for a bus route to pick up people who live right outside a city. I will use my self as an example for my idea. I live about 20 miles for a major city . If I didn't have a automobile I would not be able to get anywhere important. Now the nearest cilty has a bus route only for those in the city. But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area. The school bus service already does this , I don't know why the city could come up with a plan to offer public transportation for adults living in rural areas. It's just very stupid that this is not a thing in Houston ."
3999,15,114,['service'],"There would be a street train that would take people from downtown down the main road to the city limits. It would also connect to service to the next big city over. Bus service would be more frequent, and Uber would be allowed to begin service."
4000,15,114,['service'],"This system would be made up of a continuous stream of drivers of small vehicles.  The vehicles might be three-wheelers or some other form of small, motorized vehicles.  Besides the driver, the vehicles would only have space for two other occupants.  The vehicles would continue on the same busy stretch of road.  In other words, they would be on a fixed path.  Also, there would be a large number of these vehicles, a constant stream, so the passenger would never have to wait longer than a minute or two.  The passengers would have prepaid for the service, so there would be no need to exchange money with the driver."
4001,15,114,['service'],"Transportation would not be about getting the general population from home to work and back. It would be about moving goods and services to people directly.

This will require drone technologiy so that road infrastructure could be used to get bulk items from one place to another more efficiently and faster. Public transportation should be the rule."
4002,15,114,['service'],"Uber is not currently available in my area, because it is not seen as a large enough ""metro"" area. I believe that if several of the small communities pooled together, there would be enough available and willing drivers to start a less urban and more suburban/rural version of a paid ridesharing service. Since the communities would be pooled, there would likely be drivers from many different areas of the community, so a larger geographic area could be served."
4003,15,114,['service'],uber lyft or any taxi cabs we are a rural area very large and towns near or past 30 min away from eachother. having a taxi service would be very appreciative and would also bring more jobs locally throughout the whole southern part of this state really/

4005,15,114,['service'],"Uber style delivery service. When someone needs something picked up (groceries, take out order, new TV, etc) they can use the Uber style app to let a driver know where and what needs picking up and where it needs to be delivered.

Around my area there are a lot of close shops, so people could walk, but getting loads of bags home would be difficult.  Having mechanical walkways would enable people to do their shopping but reduce their need to use cars, and at the same time set all their bags down so they don't have to figure out how to lug them home, especially if they've purchased something heavy.  It could also allow people to get where they need to go faster, if they continue to walk along the moving sidewalk.  They could sit alongside regular sidewalks, so people who still wanted to go out for a walk and get some fresh air could do so.  The mechanical/moving sidewalks would be made out of metal, look like a flat escalator, have hand railings, and each side of the road would have a sidewalk that goes the same way as traffic."
4029,16,110,['road'],"A network of roads that we all on different levels depending on which direction you were going, so that there were never any stops that needed to be made, simply merging onto an onramp/offramp which takes you up or down a level or two and allows you to then merge onto the new direction you are desiring to travel."
4030,16,110,['road'],"a new system in my neighborhood could be bicycle - but have taxi options, so additional seats attached, perhaps rickshaw style. A person would pedal (no motors, so no issues with being on road) and there would be a seat on the back for a rider. There would be a helmet with each rider."
4031,16,110,['road'],"A new taxi service that uses mopeds rather than cars. It's something used quite frequently in other countries (such as Brazil). You would be able to call for assistance or simply stop them off the side of the road (just like a taxi, obviously)."
4032,16,110,['road'],"A new transportation system uses solar panel on the roads to empower vehicles to travel around the city. As vehicles get on the road, it automatically connects on the server of the roads and energies stored on boxes on street corners come one. These vehicles do not use gasoline, ethanol or diesel. It is greenhouse and uses electricity collected from the sun. Renewable energy that saves money and free to the entire residents meaning as long as the sun still shines, vehicles will work."
4033,16,110,['road'],"a new type of rail system with certain drop off points, but the rail system is above the road so it doesnt interfere with people driving cars."
4034,16,110,['road'],"A pod/train system that runs on the shoulder of roads. It would be more active than typical buses, and be more personal in that there can be no more than 4 passengers. It would run on a track or in the future it would would run with automatic sensing software and would drive itself."
4035,16,110,['road'],A rail system that hangs over the road where trains are suspeended from above and can carry hundreds of people
4036,16,110,['road'],"A Railway system for cars, like something out of minority report. You can still drive on the roads but the speed limit is controlled and there is never any accidents because you input your destination into a program in the individual cars and let the railway system get you there."
4037,16,110,['road'],A sidewalk peoplemover based system that could run parallel to the road or existing sidewalk.
4038,16,110,['road'],A subway could be useful in my neighbourhood.  The roads are very congested and it would be a solution for quicker commutes.
4039,16,110,['road'],"A train to the beach.  The beach is about an hour from our town (or three hours with summer traffic), and all traffic to the beach comes through our town due to an important bridge.  We could have a train that leaves from our town, or other stops nearby, and then expresses to the beach.  People would need extra room for luggage - or you could couple it with a luggage delivery system.  It would cut down on time to the beach and the number of cars on the road."
4040,16,110,['road'],"a walkway above the road. it would be totally enclosed and go parallel to the road, not across the road. so people can walk to work/down the main drag without being outside. this would facilitate walking to work."
4041,16,110,['road'],"A well established public transport system, like subway, will ease the transportation problem. It will save energy and make fewer cars on the road."
4042,16,110,['road'],All vehicles are electric. Anyone who wishes to purchase an electric moped will receive a yearly rebate to reward them for purchasing a smaller mode of transportation that is environmentally friendly and won't congest the roads quite as much.
4043,16,110,['road'],"Along any road, there can be a big truck that bicyclists, skateboarders, roller bladers, etc can hold on to to they can get a break and a boost in speed.  Whenever they need to get off, they just let go and get to their destination under their own power. There can be loading areas where the truck slows down to let people on. There can be signs and road markings to signify this."
4044,16,110,['road'],"An electric bicycle train. Everyone has their own bike, but they can all hook up to a belt that would transport them at the same speed and direction in a safe manner, maybe even on its own road."
4045,16,110,['road'],"An underground Seqway track which will take a while to build but will be extremely beneficial. There are no turns as underground paths are completely straight. Recharger stations are at every mile or two. There are practically no intersections or traffic lights except at major hubs, which are few and far between. Delivery services such as mail and UPS are a major component of this transportation system, which will make them faster and clear up traffic on major roads."
4046,16,110,['road'],Another idea would placing electricity-generating devices at intersections where cars come to a stop for a red light that would recharge the battery of hybrid/electric cars. This could be powered by solar panels attached to lighting poles along the road.
4047,16,110,['road'],"Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
4048,16,110,['road'],"Change the road into a high speed moving floor, like what they have at airport terminals but faster and with chairs to sit in.  You can board a chair in a parking lot/driveway and operate a machine to choose destination.  The chair will then merge into the moving road and go for the destination."
4049,16,110,['road'],Close some roads to motorized traffic and allow only bicycles. offering a local tax incentive for bicycling
4050,16,110,['road'],"Create a very strong drone that has bench seats for people. It'll be like a flying bus, able to get people to their destinations faster than a traditional road bus."
4051,16,110,['road'],Everything runs on automated self driving cars.  Normal cars are not allowed on the road.  Everything will run smoothly since it is computer operated and parking spaces won't be needed.  Bicyclists will no longer have to worry.
4052,16,110,['road'],"For transportation in my neighborhood we have cars, and buses. The most popular mode of transportation being the four door family sedan type car. Following that it's the minivan and then the four-door trucks. They can be seen whizzing back and forth on the roads causing many traffic jams during peak morning hours."
4053,16,110,['road'],Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
4054,16,110,['road'],Hover-cars. Would operate without tire to road friction. Would need to be computer controlled. Could take advantage of current infrastructure for route guidance.
4055,16,110,['road'],I always thought they should incorporate moving sidewalks into the city. Just like the airport. This would allow people to scoot around faster without putting more people on the road.
4056,16,110,['road'],"I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
4057,16,110,['road'],"I imagine a series of widening arches or loops of roadway and of several different sizes to accompany different types of pubic transport. Cars wouldn't be allowed in the city but stored at various exit point garages which would be provided by the city. Small roads would have small shuttles, large roads would have large fast moving shuttles that span the city. Independently, smaller walkways would be used for pedestrians and cyclists (and other man powered or tiny engine machines.) Larger walkways could become festival street fair type roads that are common in places like Greece."
4058,16,110,['road'],I imagine that instead of transporting with cars we could turn all the roads in our neighborhood into rivers and use boats to get to places.
4059,16,110,['road'],"I live in a chicago suburb and I believe that driverless cars are the future.  But what I actually prefer is everyone driving their own vehicle, what i actually hope happens in the future is that licenses are much harder to get...there are so many people out there with no clue of the rules of the road and it is hazardous to everyone around them."
4060,16,110,['road'],"I live in a rural area, it's pretty hilly but it runs along the length of a valley. It would be really nice to have a walking/bike path that connects the residential neighborhood to the commercial district without having the bike/walk on the road. Although it's generally slow traffic, walking on the road is never exactly safe. Especially in the winter. To be able to network together the few towns in the valley too would be very nice."
4061,16,110,['road'],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town. I can see the current roads changing to smaller lanes made for electric vehicles while most of the transportation needs will be fulfilled with bike and walking paths and personal hoverboard type of transportation.
4062,16,110,['road'],"I live in NYC. Travel is not too difficult, with the only real concern being the price of a subway ticket or a taxi ride. With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue. I believe that since the roads and the undergrounds are already full, the only real option is to expand transportation above ground, such as on rails between buildings. This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem."
4063,16,110,['road'],"I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
4064,16,110,['road'],"I think a method that would improve the transportation system would be to change how turn lanes are handled in America. Overseas, to turn left, you veer off to a lane on the right that comes to a stop so that you don't block traffic waiting to turn and then when it is clear, you drive across the street onto the road you were going to turn onto."
4065,16,110,['road'],"I think freelance carpooling would be a great idea. Vehicle owner can at any time turn themselves into a taxi service. The service can be run through a phone app, workers can set their own hours and rates. This would cut down on pollution, eliminate unnecessary vehicles on the road, and boost the economy overall."
4066,16,110,['road'],"I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
4067,16,110,['road'],"I think we need to tap into the power of magnets.  We can use solar panels all through the roads, then use them to power magnets on the road.  The vehicles will have oppositely polarized magnets that will be controllable in the car.  I guess it will work like those trains that use magnets, but someone smart will figure out a way to control the magnets independently.  The car battery will power the magnet on the car, and can be shut off immediately once the power is cut in case of emergency."
4068,16,110,['road'],"I think we should incentivize walking. Tax breaks for people who walk to/from work. Discounts offered by businesses if you walk to their store. Municipalities will save by not needing to pave/upkeep roads. Less impermeable surfaces mean less runoff to deal with, etc etc. Sometimes the best innovation is redeploying the simplest of technologies..."
4069,16,110,['road'],"I would like to see a bicycle highway.  It would go the length of regular highways, but be for bikes and pedestrians.  It should be wide enough for fast moving road cyclist, it should have passing lanes, and little road crossings.  There should be frequent on and off ramps.  There should also be many large parking areas.  Ideally it would even lead to public transportation areas with ample bike parking."
4070,16,110,['road'],I would like to see a high speed train connect all the major cities in my state as well as the major cities bordering our state.  I envision this high speed train to have minimal stations.  This would eliminate the need for air travel and long road trips.
4071,16,110,['road'],I would like to see a hover system that occupies the same route as roads and highways to bypass traffic.
4072,16,110,['road'],"I would love to see some kind of computer-operated taxi service in my city. The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
4073,16,110,['road'],I would love to see the use of self propelled equipment like hover boards and such used to help decrease emissions from cars. Highways and roads could be established just for such travelors. and we would also save money on gas
4074,16,110,['road'],I would think a fleet of hovercraft would be amazing.  They wouldnt damage roads like cars and would allow people to get around with a minimum usage of energy.
4075,16,110,['road'],I'd like to see some kind of motorcycle rental system in my neighborhood. This would be really convienant and I imagine quite affordable as well. There tends to be a lot of traffic in my area too so this would prevent the roads from becoming too congested. I live in a high tourism area as well and I think this would be more fun for people to explore the city than renting traditional cars.
4076,16,110,['road'],"I'd like to see underground travel possible through out the city.   Some massive tunnels, where you would have to take side tunnels to exits, but there would be major arteries.  It would replace a lot of above ground roads."
4077,16,110,['road'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
4078,16,110,['road'],"In the interest of reducing traffic and accidents, a new series of self-driving only roads and lanes are opened.  On these roads, ONLY self driving cars are authorized to drive, and on them there are no speed limits (not that the self-driving cars would be going that much faster than normal). Unfettered by the chaos of common roads and the limitations of human judgement, these exclusively self-driving vehicle areas allow the navigational AIs to coordinate for an optimally fast and efficient journey."
4079,16,110,['road'],"It would be great if we could improve the pubic transportation and reduce the number of cars on the road. I would like to see self driving buses as well as bus only lanes and self driving cars. No manually controlled cars would be allowed and because of this hopefully the roads will be safer because most accidents and caused by human error. We could have the speed limits increased as well because self driving cars can ""see"" a lot father ahead than humans."
4080,16,110,['road'],"It would replace everything: roads, sideways, buses, etc. It would be electric powered. Definitely automated. You should be able to transport to wherever you want to go without lifting a finger. Since it would replace sidewalks, you can simple stand on it and it would move you from one place to another, like a conveyor belt. It would be financed by monthly subscription, with VIP access for a higher price you can travel on the road with automatic cars that would operate in similar fashion."
4081,16,110,['road'],more bike paths for people to use instead of roads
4082,16,110,['road'],more side roads for less congestion on main roads
4083,16,110,['road'],"Moving platforms that function like traincars and moving sidewalks put together. They would go above roads, have railings on each side and be like busses with bus stops. You could buy a thing like a bus pass that allows you x number of rides, so that you don't have to have cash on your person to be able to get on it. It would run from neighborhoods to main city areas and only be running when people call for it/use it to save money on electricity/gas/whatever"
4084,16,110,['road'],My idea is a car application that notifies you when you get in about the weather and road conditions.
4085,16,110,['road'],My Idea would be to make the alleyways in my city a lot more bike friendly.  Honestly they are very rarely ever used by the city or homeowners so to make them this way would be beneficial for so many others. This would I believe encourage more people to use bicycles since I know I am terrified when riding my bicycle next to extremely lage and fast moving automobile traffic on my cities roads and highways.
4086,16,110,['road'],My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
4087,16,110,['road'],Obviously self driving cars are going to be the norm in 10 years.  It's basically just a standard vehicle with additional software and mechanical components that let it interact with the road and other vehicles without user input.  You'll be able to just hop in and be taken to wherever you need to go that has a road to it while you relax.
4088,16,110,['road'],"One day per month (at least) cars should be banned from the roads. Some buses could be allowed to allow for transportation of people who can't walk or bike, but this would be a great way to encourage human-powered transport and allow people to see the fun in this activity without increased danger from car traffic.  This would also be great for the environment."
4089,16,110,['road'],"One thing I would love to see in my local area is rent able electric scooters. They would be good for the environment, easy to maintain, and reduce traffic in terms of larger vehicles on the road."
4090,16,110,['road'],"Our new transportation system would involve golf carts.  Several roads would be designated as golf-cart-only areas and include parking.  New paths could be created because they take up less space than normal roads and even designated lanes on existing roads could be defined to use existing infrastructure.  The environment would be healthier with less pollutants, crowding would be less due to smaller size vehicles, and it would even encourage healthier lifestyles out in the air and sunshine."
4091,16,110,['road'],"Pedestrians and cyclists  will develop sensing, intent recognition, and vehicle control  itsâ€™ knowledge, skills and experience to the Safe  vulnerable road users"
4092,16,110,['road'],People step into a box which is like an elevator. It zooms around the streets taking you where you want to go. it runs on a track runs in the street. The track is a small groove in the street that isn't disruptive and allows cars to continue to travel on the road.
4093,16,110,['road'],"ROAD TRANSPORT - BICYCLE (GOOD EXERCISE FOR OUR WHOLE BODY, LOW COST AND NO POLLUTION.

4100,16,110,['road'],"roads that are like people movers so that you dont really have to drive they just move the car for you, save gas and no accidents"
4101,16,110,['road'],roads with different speed limits so people that want to drive faster can go on one and people driving slower on the other
4102,16,110,['road'],Solar powered roads and highways. We could install solar panels on the concrete and find some way to cover it so panels don't get destroyed. That way any vehicle can use the energy to power itself and travel as it passes on the road. The economy as well as the average person would save a ton of money. The change on the environment would also be beneficial.
4103,16,110,['road'],some type of elevated train/bus system that didnt use the same roads as cars
4104,16,110,['road'],"the sidewalks should move, and there should be bicycle lanes that move as well so that you can move on the double via the moving roads' motion and the bicycles' motion"
4105,16,110,['road'],The transportation system would be a combination of roads with cars and a railroad track. All of the cars would be connected and be able to drive themselves. Cars would all be on tracks and controlled by the car itself. This would lower accidents and allow for better traffic. Cars would be able to accelerate much faster as there is no driver intervention and you don't have to wait for other cars to accelerate or worry about where other cars are going.
4106,16,110,['road'],There are a lot of fairly narrow paths in between buildings in my area. It would be good if they could be paved smoother to be used by bicyclists. It would make their travel more efficient and would also increase their safety as they wouldn't have to spend as much time on roads meant for cars.
4107,16,110,['road'],"There are many back roads and residential routes around my neighborhood, so speed isn't as much of an issue to keep pace with traffic. I'd imagine a fleet of scooters that could be rented cheaply and easily could help residents get around town without much issue."
4108,16,110,['road'],There could be a really good motorcycle driver that would drive fast and come pick you up. He would know back roads and side allys very well. He could weve in and out of traffic and get you somewhere really fast.
4109,16,110,['road'],there will be driver-less cars and a lite rail system. There will still be some (free) bus transportation to fill in the gaps and help negate the need for new roads
4110,16,110,['road'],"There would be a street train that would take people from downtown down the main road to the city limits. It would also connect to service to the next big city over. Bus service would be more frequent, and Uber would be allowed to begin service."
4111,16,110,['road'],There would be skateboard like devices that run on tracks that are embedded into the roads of the city. People could use a phone app to schedule for one of the boards to pick them up. The device would show up int he street outside of your house or wherever you currently are. You would hop on and you would put the address into the app of where you wanted to go.
4112,16,110,['road'],This area could really use a super speed train that goes much faster than traffic. It could travel above the road system and would save tons of time for many people.
4113,16,110,['road'],"This idea is called 'Rolling taxi'. The system is a large ball. single large ball. Inside the ball, people can sit . People sit or stand at the centre of the ball. As ball rolls on specially made road the centre region doesn't move. The centre region where people sit is attached to the  inner surface of the ball in a special manner so that people do not move. The speed and direction of the ball can control using technology. The ball roll all across the city with people inside on a special track. Speed is high and expense is less. Also it is fun."
4114,16,110,['road'],"This is about a single user system. It is similar to a bicycle. But it's does not run on road. It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable. We take it from home or rent from government."
4115,16,110,['road'],"This system would be made up of a continuous stream of drivers of small vehicles.  The vehicles might be three-wheelers or some other form of small, motorized vehicles.  Besides the driver, the vehicles would only have space for two other occupants.  The vehicles would continue on the same busy stretch of road.  In other words, they would be on a fixed path.  Also, there would be a large number of these vehicles, a constant stream, so the passenger would never have to wait longer than a minute or two.  The passengers would have prepaid for the service, so there would be no need to exchange money with the driver."
4116,16,110,['road'],This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.
4117,16,110,['road'],"Transportation would not be about getting the general population from home to work and back. It would be about moving goods and services to people directly.

This will require drone technologiy so that road infrastructure could be used to get bulk items from one place to another more efficiently and faster. Public transportation should be the rule."
4118,16,110,['road'],Use of a sky tram.  It runs over the roads so that it doesn't increase traffic.
4119,16,110,['road'],We could have hover board paths that would allow people to go short distances without driving all the time. A path to the side of the road strictly for hoverboards or other electric devices used to get around.
4120,16,110,['road'],"we need dedicated motorcycle streets, preferably underground, i live in a very populated city (not LA status but still very urban) and ive often thought that a small underground road system built primarily for two wheeled street vehicles would not only cut down on traffic but the pollotuion created could them be trapped and prevented from being released into the atmosphere... it would cause motorcycle sales to skyrocket and there by provide another added economic benefit."
4121,16,110,['road'],"we need individual stand up scooters for citys almost like the 2 wheeled ones we have now but run on electric under the road, or even like personal unicycles that take people around. totally different topic how about Walmart allows you to make your shopping list online and they drop it off at your house on routes city distribution"
4122,16,110,['road'],We should have an underground subway system. For a city as large as the one I live in it would make sense. It would be faster for everyone and clear the roads of buses that clog up traffic during rush hour.
4123,16,110,['road'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
4124,16,110,['road'],"Change the road into a high speed moving floor, like what they have at airport terminals but faster and with chairs to sit in.

4128,17,101,['rail'],"A light rail from city center to neighboring suburbs that would replace thousands of commuters and make rush hours less crowded and stressful. This could be as simple as one station in each suburb (thus 10-15 total stations), or a more complex system with multiple stations in each suburb."
4129,17,101,['rail'],A light rail that goes around town quickly and efficiently with routes that will help the people who use it most.
4130,17,101,['rail'],"A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.  They would park their cars before entering the city, and use this quick system for getting around.  No more crowded, expensive parking in the city."
4131,17,101,['rail'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
4132,17,101,['rail'],"a new type of rail system with certain drop off points, but the rail system is above the road so it doesnt interfere with people driving cars."
4133,17,101,['rail'],"A rail cart, that is powered by friction and capturing the head it produces while being driven down the rail, it starts with a simple pedal of a bike to create enough momentum and friction to start the process going and then as soon as you produce enough energy to get it moving, it will continue to produce and move forward till you press the brakes. BAM!"
4134,17,101,['rail'],A rail system that goes from the outlying suburbs to the big city.
4135,17,101,['rail'],A rail system that hangs over the road where trains are suspeended from above and can carry hundreds of people
4136,17,101,['rail'],A rail system that is build from the ground up. This would be capable of high speeds typically not able to travel when driving or on another train. This would make work transit much faster.
4137,17,101,['rail'],A rail that goes back and forth from campus with known arrival times would be ideal for students to travel from campus to their homes and neighborhoods. This would be like a miniature above ground subway.
4138,17,101,['rail'],"A sort of rail line, but it's a single rail and has many hanging carts. The carts hold maybe 4 people at a time, like a taxi. The price would be cheaper than a bus and they would arrive quickly when you need them. You could push a button on poles that are located around the city, far more often than bus stops, and the cart will come to you quickly and take you directly to your destination. No need for bus drivers or waiting for traffic!"
4139,17,101,['rail'],A subway system where you sit in a seat that attaches to a rail as soon as you are seated. You are then transported to your destination. This removes the need to wait for trains like a regular subway.
4140,17,101,['rail'],"A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."
4141,17,101,['rail'],"A system where there are rails above you and nothing underneath you.

You sit in a cart of sorts and you are guided along near the streets, maybe above the streets or sidewalk.

The railings connect overhead and end at each sidewalk and gives you a nice view of the neighborhood, kind of like a ski-lift."
4142,17,101,['rail'],Adding a light rail system to support the university and the surrounding apartments.
4143,17,101,['rail'],"An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
4144,17,101,['rail'],"An elevated wagon wheel shaped, high speed rail system would be excellent. The outer ring would be bi-directional allowing quick transport around the city. The spokes would be bi-directional and allow quick transport from inner and outer within the quadrants."
4145,17,101,['rail'],An overhead rail system.
4146,17,101,['rail'],An underground rail system would be great. That way you could get around without having to get stuck in traffic.  There are so many cars in this area that we are known for our traffic.
4147,17,101,['rail'],"Another idea for a new transportation system would be a magnetic bullet train system, similar to the one they have in Japan. It would be a national rail system built over the old railroads we have now. It would go to every major city in America and would take half the time to do so."
4148,17,101,['rail'],"Automated bus lines that run to every street in America. Something similar to a trolley system, without the rails."
4149,17,101,['rail'],Bicycles with wheels like trains are placed on rails and whoever is going to the market takes this bsicycle and with little bit of paddling the bicycle can reach the destination. There should be distance system where two bicycles should be impossible to collide.
4150,17,101,['rail'],"chairs on rails, slow moving chairs down main streets that you can just hop on and ride to where you want to go"
4151,17,101,['rail'],Create an underground rail system that allows people to travel to all major hubs of the city. This would save gas and ease pollution.
4152,17,101,['rail'],"Driverless cars, it's the only thing I can imagine being different in my neighborhood.  We do not have room for new rail systems."
4153,17,101,['rail'],Electric rail transports. They existed in Detroit before GM had them eliminated. Essentially bicycle lanes with individual vehicles instead that run on electric wires.
4154,17,101,['rail'],extremely light rail. People hop into 1 person rail cars that take up less room than a bike lane. There would be no waiting at the rail station because it leaves as soon as you get in.
4155,17,101,['rail'],"From small towns to big cities, public transportation is helping to generate new vitality like never

before. Beautiful, walkable town squares combine residential, retail, office, recreation and public

transportation features to make community living easy. New bus services and light rail extensions

improve mobility and ease congestion. Even the smallest adjustments, like widening sidewalks and

adding bikeways, can provide dramatic impact and value."
4156,17,101,['rail'],Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
4157,17,101,['rail'],High speed rail
4158,17,101,['rail'],High speed rail train
4159,17,101,['rail'],Human sized drones. Highspeed rail like Japan has.Self driveable cars with an uber type interface. (cab drivers r terrible people)
4160,17,101,['rail'],"I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
4161,17,101,['rail'],I believe that we should have personalized rail system fro our neighborhood. The whole nei8ghborhhod should have a few of them available to different destinations. When someone wants to go there they hit a button and it sends it to them.
4162,17,101,['rail'],I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
4163,17,101,['rail'],"I imagine a loop in my city where anyone would be able to have a short walk to the 'main artery' and be able to get anywhere at a major point within minutes; perhaps this would be a rail suspended above the city, or otherwise away from other major traffic; it would really help in efficiency of moving people around."
4164,17,101,['rail'],"I live in a neighborhood near an excellent metro system, but not walkable to it. I would like a people-mover sort of system that travels through the neighborhood making the existing metro station more accessible. Perhaps small cars or pods at the end of each street that travel along an elevated rail directly to the metro station."
4165,17,101,['rail'],I live in a rural community about 1 hour from a city. I would like to see this area build a light rail commuter line that could link these isolated communities and boost the economy. Many people out here do not even have cars.
4166,17,101,['rail'],"I live in NYC. Travel is not too difficult, with the only real concern being the price of a subway ticket or a taxi ride. With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue. I believe that since the roads and the undergrounds are already full, the only real option is to expand transportation above ground, such as on rails between buildings. This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem."
4167,17,101,['rail'],I live in the suburbs so all the rail lines converge on the central city. It would be nice if there was a light rail system that linked the different major suburbs together. You could connect it to the lines going to the city and across the country.
4168,17,101,['rail'],"I lived in Japan and really enjoyed their system of underground rail. I think most cities in the United States could benefit from such a system, which has the added benefit of cutting down on DUIs. There is no rail system in my town."
4169,17,101,['rail'],I think a new transportation that utilizes a type of rail system on the sidewalks that people can easily easily walk throughout the neighborhood - similar to the moving walkways at airports.  Sort of like a conveyor belt for people.
4170,17,101,['rail'],I think adding a rail system in my city would be a great idea. The only public transportation we have is buses and there are a lot of areas they don't even run to. So I think a rail system would do wonders in getting a lot of other people where they were going.
4171,17,101,['rail'],"I think an automatic bus, possibly on a rail system so the times would be more predictable and rigorous."
4172,17,101,['rail'],"I think for small towns like mine (20,000) we should have a cross between a trolley and a hoverboard. If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
4173,17,101,['rail'],I think that there could be a light rail system or electric buses. there is enough sunlight to make them 100% clean
4174,17,101,['rail'],I think that we need a rail system for our city. Its a growing city with lost of bigger cities around it. A main rail system like a subway would make things much easier to get from place to place.
4175,17,101,['rail'],"I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
4176,17,101,['rail'],"I would like an interchangeable form of light rail, in which the train would have several compartments that would be destined for multiple locations. That way you just get on the train, and the train goes to an interchange. At the interchange the compartments are separated (I imagine they are held together by magnets) and grouped together by location. Once all the compartments that are going to the same area are together, the train leaves. It would work like changing trains, except you wouldn't have to go outside."
4177,17,101,['rail'],I would like there to be a fast speed rail such as in Japan or Germany. I picture it being accurate time-wise and capable of transporting people over great distances. I would prefer it to a bus situation.
4178,17,101,['rail'],"I would like to see a People Mover connecting Trenton, Southgate, Taylor and Wyandotte. There seems to be a lot of people walking down streets such as Trenton and Eureka, and especially so in the winter. I can envision a rail system supported by local tax dollars very similar to the one to the north in Detroit. People around here are constantly complaining about weather conditions and global warming and I think my method could bring a lot of people together and solve a lot of the commuting problems around here. There are just so many cars and it seems there is an average of just 1.5 people per vehicle. It is rather said. I really would want to push toward the people mover rail systems."
4179,17,101,['rail'],I would like to see an expanded light rail system with more of a neighborhood connection.  Right now our light rail pretty much just connects the Downtown core with the airport.
4180,17,101,['rail'],"I would like to see lightrail or street cars inbny neighbor hood.   Something that was powered in part by alternative energy.  Solar panels on the stations, perhaps on top of the light rail cars."
4181,17,101,['rail'],I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
4182,17,101,['rail'],I would love a rail system to be installed in our city going north/south along the coast.
4183,17,101,['rail'],"I would love for there to a more intergrated train system in my city (specifically my neighborhood.) I'd love to be able to hop on a train (or streetcar) and be able to transfer to a larger rail system that would take me to other cities, etc. Something like what european cities have."
4184,17,101,['rail'],I would love if my neighborhood had a rail system that worked from magnets and floated along the rail at high speeds.  I wish that the cars were individual and that I could get in and select from a list of destinations.  I would like my own car and to be able to bring my dogs with me.  It would be fast and smooth and work with minimal power.
4185,17,101,['rail'],I would love to see a light rail system in my community. I am thinking of above ground trains that would run to the various suburbs and take people to various local stops. These trains should run a regular schedule so people can use them to commute.
4186,17,101,['rail'],I would love to see more light rail transit added to Pittsburgh to alleviate some of the traffic congestion under ground
4187,17,101,['rail'],"I would love to see Pittsburgh, PA use some of unused railroads for light rail service. Many of our existing routes were cut, unfortuantely."
4188,17,101,['rail'],"I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
4189,17,101,['rail'],In the city i live in there is no public transportation. If some rails or buses could be brought in it could help a lot of people here.
4190,17,101,['rail'],"It is similar to the monorail at Wald Disney world. It goes all around the town and stops when people use an app and state they need a pickup. It can go to individual streets and addresses because it needs no rails, but can use multiple-line systems to navigate the town. It makes scheduled stops, but can also be called by the app. It is free, paid for by local and state taxes, and very clean and quick. People use it for a wide variety of uses, from nights on the town, to grocery shopping, to work commute. It is very safe, clean and fun."
4191,17,101,['rail'],"It would be great for our city to offer more access to the rails.  We could use an updated rail system that would make traveling to our larger cities in the state faster, more available, and yet still affordable.  It could bring more people to live in our city if they could travel fast to the big city and help grow our town here.  Our town is terribly depressed and I think that having a high-speed train or just general more options to travel through it would bring a massive amount of revenue into the city."
4192,17,101,['rail'],Just a more streamlined bus and rail service. I'd make buses easier to track.
4193,17,101,['rail'],light rail
4194,17,101,['rail'],Light rail around the city.
4195,17,101,['rail'],Light rail connecting outer neighborhoods to the city would be good for everyone for jobs and business.
4196,17,101,['rail'],Light rail system that reaches even the furthest suburbs.
4197,17,101,['rail'],"Light rail. Basically, street card running between the most popular stops. They don't have to run everywhere, but on their routes they'd be more efficient than buses. You count put the rails on the side of the streets, near the sidewalks."
4198,17,101,['rail'],monorail loop from college to mall to hospital to rail line
4199,17,101,['rail'],"Monorail through the city! Just like Disneyland, this city-wide system allows you to see the city from a bird's eye! Simply get on at one of the many stations around town and enjoy your ride without stops, traffic or bad weather. The rails above the city means growth can continue without getting in the way of transport, and means you can watch the world below!"
4200,17,101,['rail'],"My city would benefit from an elevated and enclosed train line. Regional rail is the preferred choice for many commuters but is unreliable and frustrating due to weather and traffic related delays. Though the infrastructure investment would be great, we are in need of an overhaul anyway and should improve the current system."
4201,17,101,['rail'],"My idea for public transportation would include an underground rail system powered by magnets. Because of the varied climate as well as prevalence natural disasters in my area, having the system underground seems like the best idea. The train would stop a lot more often than normal trains; At the end of every street at least. It would have a separate exit system in order to not lose quite as much time loading and unloading passengers."
4202,17,101,['rail'],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
4203,17,101,['rail'],"My neighborhood/city/state is ultra conservative- so having bike lanes would be an improvement. Even though this city I live in (Huntsville, AL) has more Ph.D's per capita we are still woefully behind. Since it's such a tech town with so many engineers though...it would have to be something very advanced to get these engineers on board. Like some sort of train driven by magnetic rails."
4204,17,101,['rail'],"My transportation suggestion (in my town) would be to avoid the freeways and allow me to get to work using a rail way-type system.  This would be either underground or overground.  This is not an something that we see on the west coast a lot, so it would be very helpful to many commuters in the town I live."
4205,17,101,['rail'],"Off the ground magnetic rails have high speed autonomous trains that anyone can use, and it gets you to areas much faster than can now be done."
4206,17,101,['rail'],"One Idea I've always had was sky trams. It would operate just like your traditional tram system but instead of a point A to point B ride. You would have an additional 5 to 10 stops on a linear path, to support the stops I would use a magnetic rail system, instead of the old wire cable system. This would cut down on over crowding in terms of public and private transportation."
4207,17,101,['rail'],"One on rails , but it has seats inside a bubble that hangs below the rails."
4208,17,101,['rail'],"Our City has no nearby neighbors. Any future ideas are going to require a rail system, preferably something fast like japanese trains. Maglev technology which will allow faster travel from coastal towns and cities to the capital."
4209,17,101,['rail'],public rail
4210,17,101,['rail'],remove all non commercial traffic.  have extensive light rail connected to robust subway system.  have storage containers deliver large goods.
4211,17,101,['rail'],Since I live in the country it would be an rail service that goes through and above the trees to go to town. It would stop at certain places but would go through the pretty parts of the country
4212,17,101,['rail'],"Since rail is very expensive, I'd like to see more express bus routes, hopefully with their own lanes to keep them flowing faster than traffic and give an incentive to use them.  Make the buses as comfortable as possible, again as an incentive for use."
4213,17,101,['rail'],Some kind of public transportation like light rail that goes nearby would be ideal. If we could have a light rail or subway system that connects the city to the suburbs that would greatly improve the traffic situation.
4214,17,101,['rail'],"Tampa, FL is one of the largest metro areas in the country without any sort of rail system, and traffic is bad. I would love to see a commuter rail system in our town, with a downtown hub and then lines extending north to the Wesley Chapel/Lutz area, out to Brandon, and then another line out to the Westshore/Airport area."
4215,17,101,['rail'],The neighborhood needs a rail system that runs adjacent to the highway. This would go from major city to major city with the same stops as for those that drive.
4216,17,101,['rail'],"The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
4217,17,101,['rail'],The subway station can be replaced with magnetic levitation train. The subway train use electrically charged magnets to lift and move above the rail tracks.
4218,17,101,['rail'],The terrain where I live can make public transportation hard to develop. It is very hilly. There is a main highway/route that runs straight enough that a rail system could work. It would be good to get people to the more populated section that could then hook up easily with other modes of public transportation (which do not exist right now but it could be done). It would not be high speed as there would need to be several stops along the way. It could be done with an electric source that would not be harmful for pollution.
4219,17,101,['rail'],"There could be some kind of light rail system for the people.  It would make stops at malls, universities, grocery stores, and various event centers."
4220,17,101,['rail'],There was an idea to get a high speed rail in my town. It never happened but it would have been cool. It would have taken half an hour to get to a town 2 hours way. It would have been innovative! But the government shut down the idea. For what reason? Who knows.
4221,17,101,['rail'],there will be driver-less cars and a lite rail system. There will still be some (free) bus transportation to fill in the gaps and help negate the need for new roads
4222,17,101,['rail'],"There would be a four inch tall metal rail running between the sidewalk and curb, up and down every street. There would be small carts powered with gravity batteries that would run on the rails. This would help people stop relying on fossil fuel transportation"
4223,17,101,['rail'],"This new transportation system is a bullet train in the sky, able to span around the neighborhood with up to 700 passengers in under two minutes. It's sleek silver coat is never late, and always early to make sure everyone gets where they need to go. The rails float there in the sky, ready to carry this majestic beauty to the ends of the neighborhood making sure everyone is early"
4224,17,101,['rail'],"Use a sky rail train to transport people.  Similar to a subway, but rather than below ground, it would be above ground."
4225,17,101,['rail'],We could have helicopters that move from certain places in the city to farther ones.  Somewhat like a light rail system but from different ends of the city.  It could make jumps to each different port that would be faster than any other travel.
4226,17,101,['rail'],We have no light rail
4227,18,99,['town'],A bike path that has a divider between the road and the bike path. A dedicated bike path that has a sense of security could encourage more people to bike around town since they wouldn't need to share the road with cars.
4228,18,99,['town'],"A Bus system, within the metro area that was funded by a tax on gas purchased by individual commuters. In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."
4229,18,99,['town'],A car pool van that does loops around our town picking up kids and dropping them off at various activities. There can be an app that works to hail the van and parents can track where its going
4230,18,99,['town'],"A central hub for a ridesharing service that provides cars for small groups to take to neighboring towns. I live in a rural area, a few minutes from a very small village. The nearest SMALL city is about 30 minutes away, and the nearest decent sized city is almost an hour away. A ridesharing service would make accessing these places much easier, and if the company provided the car (for a fee, of course), those without vehicles could be serviced."
4231,18,99,['town'],A electric scooter sharing program for getting around town without having to drive a car and use too much gas or take up too much space.
4232,18,99,['town'],A going to town app. In a rural area like where I live sometimes you avoid going to town because you don't have a ride or you just don't feel you can justify driving all that way just to run a quick errand. Enter an app that connects you to people along your travel rout who also need to go into town. You could flag yourself as offering a ride or needing a ride.
4233,18,99,['town'],A golf cart-like train that circles the small town I live in on a regular basis.
4234,18,99,['town'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
4235,18,99,['town'],"A jitney that makes local stops within a few miles of a small town.  My town would be perfect as an example.  Most errands can be run in a 10 mile radius.  This includes, post office, shopping centers, DMV, library, etc.  there could be a call in to meet at nearest cross stop.  We have 2 main roads that run through town so this would be very easy to implement."
4236,18,99,['town'],A light rail that goes around town quickly and efficiently with routes that will help the people who use it most.
4237,18,99,['town'],"A magnetic roadway system, where people move in modular pods that are controlled by a central operating system (COS). Magnets underneath the street guide your pod along, and every movement of all of the pods is controlled perfectly by the computerized system, it is completely autonomous. If your whole family wants to go into town, you assemble your four-pod system and take off, where traffic is optimized perfectly by the COS. If just you are on your way to work, you hop in your single passenger pod, and take off!"
4238,18,99,['town'],"A network of quadcopters (drones) large enough to transport humans. Let's say you need to get to the other side of town quickly, and want to avoid traffic -- get in a drone and have it deliver you by air!"
4239,18,99,['town'],A new bus route that could go through my town. It would have a different route than the buses we currently have.
4240,18,99,['town'],"A new transportation idea would be to have bikes that can be rented.  I have seen this in some towns such as Austin, Texas.  Where you can find a bank of rental bikes every couple of blocks.  How awesome would it be if this was more normal and people could choose to ride a bike to the store to grab a loaf of bread or something, rather than getting in the car and wasting gas and adding to pollution."
4241,18,99,['town'],"A new transportation system in my neighborhood could be the use of drones to fly individuals in and around town, or to far off destinations. The drones would fly like helicopters, but can  can also be controlled using a remote control. Unlike a car which can transport several passengers, the drone would be only be able to transport one person."
4242,18,99,['town'],"A overhanging monorail. There are a lot of key locations close together, this would be great for my town."
4243,18,99,['town'],A ship that takes you around town within minutes and costs less than other methods of transportation.
4244,18,99,['town'],"A train to the beach.  The beach is about an hour from our town (or three hours with summer traffic), and all traffic to the beach comes through our town due to an important bridge.  We could have a train that leaves from our town, or other stops nearby, and then expresses to the beach.  People would need extra room for luggage - or you could couple it with a luggage delivery system.  It would cut down on time to the beach and the number of cars on the road."
4245,18,99,['town'],a trolley system that goes through the main line of town. hop on/hop off style so that people can use it to get to work
4246,18,99,['town'],"An underground system in my small town like a subway. But instead of a subway underground, it would be those moving sidewalks you see in the airports that you could walk or glide quickly from place to place."
4247,18,99,['town'],"autonomous vehicles abound. there are shared autonomous vehicles that can be called by neighborhood members. you may travel to destinations within your town only. the cost is shared by real estate tax. the benefit is a drastic reduction in traffic congestion, as much fewer cars are needed."
4248,18,99,['town'],"City buses that actually go downtown and to the places that people need to go, instead of just around the edges of town. Also, have a fleet of bikes that people could rent for $1/hr to ride the distances downtown like some other cities."
4249,18,99,['town'],"Currently, I live in a small town that has a public transportation system. However, you have to call and wait for the bus to pick you up, instead of waiting at a pre-determined stop, and it can take forever to get where you're going. I propose a busing system that's like the one in bigger cities for my neighborhood. People could still call and wait for a bus, but buses should also stop and pick people up at predetermined stops at regular intervals."
4250,18,99,['town'],"Due to the amount of traffic around Tampa and surrounding towns, there is much congestion during rush hours. To help alleviate some of this, I suggest uni-directional bridge to be built that reduce traffic during rush hours. In the morning, the bridge would allow traffic going west towards the base. In the evening, traffic would flow to the east."
4251,18,99,['town'],"From small towns to big cities, public transportation is helping to generate new vitality like never

before. Beautiful, walkable town squares combine residential, retail, office, recreation and public

transportation features to make community living easy. New bus services and light rail extensions

improve mobility and ease congestion. Even the smallest adjustments, like widening sidewalks and

adding bikeways, can provide dramatic impact and value."
4252,18,99,['town'],Have a monorail system around town. It'll reduce pollution because people will have fun using it instead of driving their cars.
4253,18,99,['town'],Horse drawn carriage would rock here in this southwestern mountain town. People would really love it and it would be more reasonable for my area than just your average bus or taxi.
4254,18,99,['town'],"How about a rent-a-Segway system?  Kind of like Zipcars or the bicycle rentals in big cities - you could pick up a Segway at a docking station in one part of town and then drop it off at one in another part of town.  You would probably need some sort of point of sale system for a deposit on the Segway, but otherwise the city could price it however they wanted."
4255,18,99,['town'],"Huge people can carry smaller people ""piggy back"" style to their destinations.  My town is small so it wouldn't be very long."
4256,18,99,['town'],I can see a transport type system where someone steps on a pad and it transport them digitally over to where they want to go within a town. kinda like the thing they had in willy wonkas chocolate factory but without the death ray pointer thing it would be just a pad like a dance dance revolution pad.
4257,18,99,['town'],I can use the battery bike to avoid the air pollution in my home town
4258,18,99,['town'],"I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
4259,18,99,['town'],I imagine a railway system that goes through my town and all around the united states. It would be a bullet train like they have in europe that hovers and goes fast. It would be affordable too.
4260,18,99,['town'],I imagine a transportation system in which we all use underground super chutes. They move us from place to place within our town super fast. It would have to be set up so everything is safe of course. I imagine a network of these chutes spreading throughout the city and they pop you up wherever you want to go. Wouldn't that be amazing?
4261,18,99,['town'],"I live in a fairly small town that has a decent amount of people but isn't very large in area. Solar powered railcars could be a viable option for this area. They would only have to travel short distances at once, and it could easily be utilized by everybody in town by having just a few stops. Think about the railcars in San Francisco and other major cities being completely solar powered. The electricity saving would be huge."
4262,18,99,['town'],"I live in a rural area, it's pretty hilly but it runs along the length of a valley. It would be really nice to have a walking/bike path that connects the residential neighborhood to the commercial district without having the bike/walk on the road. Although it's generally slow traffic, walking on the road is never exactly safe. Especially in the winter. To be able to network together the few towns in the valley too would be very nice."
4263,18,99,['town'],"I live in a small desert city with a major traffic congestion issue. However, despite the grid layout of the town, there is a diagonal irrigation canal running from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. Currently it has some poorly maintained walking paths, but that's about the extent of its development. Now, in the desert, loss of irrigation water to evaporation under the glaring sun is an issue. I'd propose creating a covered walkway/bike path where solar panels provide protection to the water, as well as pedestrians and cyclists. We could even use that solar energy to create small electric scooter rental/charging booths. It would provide a shortcut - a green highway from one end of town to the other."
4264,18,99,['town'],I live in a small town so I think the future transportation system in my neighborhood will be to get rid of normal sized roads and create bike and walking paths all over town. I can see the current roads changing to smaller lanes made for electric vehicles while most of the transportation needs will be fulfilled with bike and walking paths and personal hoverboard type of transportation.
4265,18,99,['town'],"i live in a somewhat smaller town in rural virginia. everything is super accessible and easy to get to. our town is gold cart friendly. my idea would be a cab service, but with golf carts. it would be a super fun way to help people get from point A to point B. it would also encourage safer driving."
4266,18,99,['town'],I live in a town right on the ocean and there are many canals here. I think a canoe taxi service would be really convenient and fun. It wouldn't get people to their desired locations super fast but it would allow people to travel leisurely and enjoy the scenery along the way. It would also be really healthy for the people driving the canoes and help them to stay fit.
4267,18,99,['town'],"I live in a town with a lot of freight trains. A subway system would be nice because it would get us places faster (the town is large in size and spread out over several miles) and be able to bypass the trains, which stop constantly. The subway would run either over the existing trains or under them and run off of cards that were prepaid like the MTAs."
4268,18,99,['town'],"i live in twin falls idaho and we could use a bus line, i guess it isn't a new idea  but yeah this is a place where there is sharp economic divide and all the businesses are on the rich side of town, the original town or the poor side of town ""old town"" is roughly a mile from the main drag so buses would be great for people who cant afford cars and better for the environment in general"
4269,18,99,['town'],"I lived in Japan and really enjoyed their system of underground rail. I think most cities in the United States could benefit from such a system, which has the added benefit of cutting down on DUIs. There is no rail system in my town."
4270,18,99,['town'],"I think a great idea for a transportation system would be a neighborhood or city that bans cars and uses all bikes to get around. This would really help the environment and people in this town would also be in really good shape. It would have to be a town that doesn't get very cold in the winter, like where I live, where people could use their bikes comfortably year round. Each bike would have to have a small basket though for people to carry their stuff."
4271,18,99,['town'],"I think for small towns like mine (20,000) we should have a cross between a trolley and a hoverboard. If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
4272,18,99,['town'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
4273,18,99,['town'],I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.
4274,18,99,['town'],I think there should be bikes that you can easily rent. You can get them in the major shopping areas and drive them around town to get excercise as well as helping to use less gasoline.
4275,18,99,['town'],"I think we should have a system like Uber set up here. Allow individuals to ""sign up"" to be drivers at the town and people can book rides via the net, text messaging, or by calling. I think this should be tax-exempt income because then the town has no issue with gas or any other expenses because it makes this more profitable to retired people or others who can't work. With the way free market works we would almost always have enough drivers!"
4276,18,99,['town'],I would go with a moped service.  There would just be mopeds position around town and you have to drop it off at your stop to check out.
4277,18,99,['town'],I would like for there to be a trolley/tram system through main street in my town. Main street goes straight through Beaver Dam and Hartford and passes by all the important stores/stops.
4278,18,99,['town'],"I would like to see a system of localized automated delivery. A system which is run as a utility for the town or city in which the focus is put on small businesses in the area. I think this could have hyper-local economic benefits, as it may help small businesses steal back sales from online marketplaces like Amazon. I see it being a motorized electric drone, that could use something like a bike lane to bring goods to local neighborhoods from small businesses in area.  it Could be coupled with a publicly run website for ordering and added revenues from ad placement on site and/or vehicles could help give money back to towns and cities."
4279,18,99,['town'],I'd like to see the railroad tracks by our house be repurposed as a walking and biking route for the neighborhood.  It would be really sweet if they could use that and carry the corridor all the way to the nearest town and shopping area.
4280,18,99,['town'],I'd love for some sort of shuttle system that worked at late hours between major points in town
4281,18,99,['town'],Imagine thousands of public bikes for you to use for short trips around town. Now imagine tens of thousands of people riding these bikes every day
4282,18,99,['town'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
4283,18,99,['town'],"It is similar to the monorail at Wald Disney world. It goes all around the town and stops when people use an app and state they need a pickup. It can go to individual streets and addresses because it needs no rails, but can use multiple-line systems to navigate the town. It makes scheduled stops, but can also be called by the app. It is free, paid for by local and state taxes, and very clean and quick. People use it for a wide variety of uses, from nights on the town, to grocery shopping, to work commute. It is very safe, clean and fun."
4284,18,99,['town'],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
4285,18,99,['town'],"It would be great for our city to offer more access to the rails.  We could use an updated rail system that would make traveling to our larger cities in the state faster, more available, and yet still affordable.  It could bring more people to live in our city if they could travel fast to the big city and help grow our town here.  Our town is terribly depressed and I think that having a high-speed train or just general more options to travel through it would bring a massive amount of revenue into the city."
4286,18,99,['town'],"it'd be cool to have a rent a shop throughout the city for people who aren't able to afford bicycles or scooters, or any other sort of transportations. the can rent an item, and return it at the other part of town."
4287,18,99,['town'],It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.
4288,18,99,['town'],"Kind of like an escalator that goes through town, but instead standing, you sit in a chair."
4289,18,99,['town'],"Many people in my town already ride bicycles to and from work or to run errands, and quite frankly I wish more of them would.  I live on a peninsula, so everyone is always competing for parking anyway.  I think bicycles are ideal for commuting in a smallish town like mine."
4290,18,99,['town'],Mardi Gras floats carry people around town (I live in New Orleans)
4291,18,99,['town'],monorail high speed that takes your from the north side of town to the south side and all the way to the airport
4292,18,99,['town'],"Monorail through the city! Just like Disneyland, this city-wide system allows you to see the city from a bird's eye! Simply get on at one of the many stations around town and enjoy your ride without stops, traffic or bad weather. The rails above the city means growth can continue without getting in the way of transport, and means you can watch the world below!"
4293,18,99,['town'],"My idea would be to use a moving belt (like used in airport terminals) instead of sidewalks to get around my neighborhood. I live is a small town (population about 500), so it would encourage people to drive less to get to destinations that are close to their homes."
4294,18,99,['town'],"My neighborhood filled with uber drives. However, there is no cost assoicated with the transit it is all provided by the town. It would be like new york city (think of cabs), however nice black cars everywhere and someone can hop in to any one they want free of charge. Baisically be like public transit with uber and they will take you wherever you want."
4295,18,99,['town'],"My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
4296,18,99,['town'],"My neighborhood/city/state is ultra conservative- so having bike lanes would be an improvement. Even though this city I live in (Huntsville, AL) has more Ph.D's per capita we are still woefully behind. Since it's such a tech town with so many engineers though...it would have to be something very advanced to get these engineers on board. Like some sort of train driven by magnetic rails."
4297,18,99,['town'],"My town is in desparate need of a form of public transportation. Everyone is reliant on a car or scooter. I think they don't have enough need to  warrant a bus route, but I'm in favor of widening the tiny bicycle lanes they have."
4298,18,99,['town'],"My transportation suggestion (in my town) would be to avoid the freeways and allow me to get to work using a rail way-type system.  This would be either underground or overground.  This is not an something that we see on the west coast a lot, so it would be very helpful to many commuters in the town I live."
4299,18,99,['town'],"Our City has no nearby neighbors. Any future ideas are going to require a rail system, preferably something fast like japanese trains. Maglev technology which will allow faster travel from coastal towns and cities to the capital."
4300,18,99,['town'],"park and go scooters, to get across town and back"
4301,18,99,['town'],"point to point lift system, like ski lifts. small town with lots of lakes and sunshine"
4302,18,99,['town'],Provide the ability to rent segways at certain locations in town.
4303,18,99,['town'],"Publicly available bicycles could be stationed at different regions of the town: different parts of the University campus, the downtown square, the region of stores and malls for shopping. This would allow students to be able to rent and use a bike to get around without having to own one and worry about its safety."
4304,18,99,['town'],"Self driving cars that could detect traffic/other cars and could navigate to a specific location would be great in this town, especially at night to avoid accidents due to intoxicated driving of college students. The cars could be rented from the town and ordered similarly to taxi cabs, and could drive students home from the bars for a fee without relying on very tired or intoxicated friends to do so."
4305,18,99,['town'],Self driving rental trucks.  They come to you instead of having to drive it all the way across town to where you live. You load  then unload your stuff then it drives itself back to the rental place.
4306,18,99,['town'],Since I live in the country it would be an rail service that goes through and above the trees to go to town. It would stop at certain places but would go through the pretty parts of the country
4307,18,99,['town'],"Since where I live gets cold, my idea is to have something like the NYC bike share, but with covered and heated cabs.  Our town isn't too big so you can pick up and drop off like a ZipCar.  The bikes would be electric so you can make it up the hills and to provide heat.  There would be an app to tell you where the nearest bike is and to report anything about it, like it being broken."
4308,18,99,['town'],"Tampa, FL is one of the largest metro areas in the country without any sort of rail system, and traffic is bad. I would love to see a commuter rail system in our town, with a downtown hub and then lines extending north to the Wesley Chapel/Lutz area, out to Brandon, and then another line out to the Westshore/Airport area."
4309,18,99,['town'],"Taxi-style self-driving cars which can be summoned via app and hired for longer journeys, or which would at least serve rural areas. Cars would probably have to be stationed at depots on the outskirts of town, activating and driving off when pinged."
4310,18,99,['town'],"The neighborhood I live in has alley ways behind our properties. So when getting kids to school in our town, we could have some sort of trolley or train-like vehicle that could go up and down the alleys picking up the kids. This would be quick and efficient and the kids would want to go to school because it would be fun and exciting."
4311,18,99,['town'],"There are many back roads and residential routes around my neighborhood, so speed isn't as much of an issue to keep pace with traffic. I'd imagine a fleet of scooters that could be rented cheaply and easily could help residents get around town without much issue."
4312,18,99,['town'],"There are many parts of my area that aren't accessible by foot or bicycle; in order to get from one section of town to another, you have to take a highway, where only motorized vehicles area allowed. This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
4313,18,99,['town'],There is no bus system so my idea is for a bus system in my area.  I live in a suburbs of a small town and there is no bus out here.  It would be nice to have one.  Sometimes I don't have access to a car and maybe this bus could help me get to the store or church.  I would also like the bus system to be able to take me to the small town to go shopping and stuff.
4314,18,99,['town'],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
4315,18,99,['town'],There was an idea to get a high speed rail in my town. It never happened but it would have been cool. It would have taken half an hour to get to a town 2 hours way. It would have been innovative! But the government shut down the idea. For what reason? Who knows.
4316,18,99,['town'],"This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."
4317,18,99,['town'],"This might be only useful for some places, but it's better than none.  I think there should be a moving walkway for the most common areas of a town or city.  This way foot traffic can be consistent and the flow high.  Since it's fairly low speed there shouldn't be any injury issues and transferring is as easy as getting off the one walkway and on to another."
4318,18,99,['town'],uber lyft or any taxi cabs we are a rural area very large and towns near or past 30 min away from eachother. having a taxi service would be very appreciative and would also bring more jobs locally throughout the whole southern part of this state really/
4319,18,99,['town'],"Unfortunately, I live in a very small/rural town, so future transportation system would likely be simple public bus transit."
4320,18,99,['town'],Using driver-less vehicles as a taxi service around town by allowing residents to reserve a ride at any time by using the town's website.
4321,18,99,['town'],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
4322,18,99,['town'],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.

4323,18,99,['town'],"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."
4324,18,99,['town'],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
4325,18,99,['town'],"We have a lot of old and unused train tracks in my town, so I like to create some kind of manually powered train type vehicle that would each fit several people and could be propelled forward either manually for free or with power for a fee."
4326,19,86,['bicycle'],A bicycle helmet with speakers and Bluetooth connectivity for your phone.
4327,19,86,['bicycle'],"A bicycle rental system that allows town-owned bicycles to be ""checked out"" at various locations throughout the city, and returned to any of several locations. This will encourage people to ride bikes, even if they do not own them themselves."
4328,19,86,['bicycle'],A bicycle rickshaw service.
4329,19,86,['bicycle'],A bicycle service for when you are not in a hurry.
4330,19,86,['bicycle'],A bicycle taxi service
4331,19,86,['bicycle'],A bicycle that can lock itself when the owner forgets to lock it.
4332,19,86,['bicycle'],"A bicycle that is completely powered using solar batteries. Therefore, it needs neither peddling nor gasoline for it to keep going."
4333,19,86,['bicycle'],A bicycle with spheres instead of wheels
4334,19,86,['bicycle'],A circular bicycle that everyone pedals together.
4335,19,86,['bicycle'],"a new system in my neighborhood could be bicycle - but have taxi options, so additional seats attached, perhaps rickshaw style. A person would pedal (no motors, so no issues with being on road) and there would be a seat on the back for a rider. There would be a helmet with each rider."
4336,19,86,['bicycle'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
4337,19,86,['bicycle'],A pedi cab service similar to Uber. People would sign up to drive people around on their bicycles. It's a small neighborhood and could easily be done. The call service could have a phone app and website to make it easier to schedule pick ups.
4338,19,86,['bicycle'],A rent a bike program. Where you can rent and return electric bicycles. It could be either manned by a person or just a machine.
4339,19,86,['bicycle'],"A rental system for electric scooters and regular bicycles where you can drop it off at any local dropoff venues (bars, stores, etc). Pay by hours. An app with a map that shows all options, and also has ride-sharing help."
4340,19,86,['bicycle'],A sidewalk that is automatic.  It could allow people to get around faster than what walking would do.  It also would help others with being able to carry things that they couldn't possibly carry all by themselves.  It could help with getting people where they need to go at the rate of speed as a bicycle.  This would help out tons of people that have had a rough tiring day but don't want to use a vehicle to get back home.
4341,19,86,['bicycle'],"A transportation system would include wide use of self-driving cars to facilitate efficiency and safety. Cars may be privately owned, or there may be a pay-as-you go or contract type system if you do not wish to own a vehicle. There would also be a total bike lane system for those who prefer to ride bicycles. The bike lanes would be much safer than what exists now."
4342,19,86,['bicycle'],A velodrome type system for bicycles.
4343,19,86,['bicycle'],"An electric bicycle train. Everyone has their own bike, but they can all hook up to a belt that would transport them at the same speed and direction in a safe manner, maybe even on its own road."
4344,19,86,['bicycle'],An on demand bicycle system where a truck (with a trailer?) will bring a bicycle to your current location and then you can leave it in place when you're done. Reservations could be made in advance using an app.
4345,19,86,['bicycle'],Automated Bicycle Rental Station. When i was visiting colorado i was so fascinated to see that they had Bicycle Rental Station nearly everywhere.  That be so cool to have in my city!

4353,19,86,['bicycle'],"Electric bicycles that work only within a specified area. Like shopping carts that lock wheels when taken too far away from the store, these bikes would lock up when taken outside the area. Anyone can use these bikes within this area."
4354,19,86,['bicycle'],Electric rail transports. They existed in Detroit before GM had them eliminated. Essentially bicycle lanes with individual vehicles instead that run on electric wires.
4355,19,86,['bicycle'],Future transportation system in my neighborhood could be a electric bicycle taxi system where neighborhood resents can take shorts trips like the grocery store or sending kids off to school.
4356,19,86,['bicycle'],"Hire young, strong people to peddle multi-passenger bicycles"
4357,19,86,['bicycle'],"How about a rent-a-Segway system?  Kind of like Zipcars or the bicycle rentals in big cities - you could pick up a Segway at a docking station in one part of town and then drop it off at one in another part of town.  You would probably need some sort of point of sale system for a deposit on the Segway, but otherwise the city could price it however they wanted."
4358,19,86,['bicycle'],"I don't anticipate the transportation system changing too much in my area no matter the time frame. I think the car will rule for the next several decades, but I would like the cars to change. They need not be so huge, and would be powered by plug-in type electrical engines. Each home would have a solar array and this would power your home, and your car. A back-up natural gas power plant would help out if it's cloudy for weeks. Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
4359,19,86,['bicycle'],I imagine a type of highway for bicycles where people can use on and off ramps easily to reach their destination. They wont have to worry about cars since its a bike only highway system. it will get people to their destination quicker since they dont have to stop at traffic lights and watch out for pedestrians.
4360,19,86,['bicycle'],"I live in a small village.  Everything is close together, so it might be possible to have a bicycle share program.  Bicycles could be borrowed and then returned to the same place or a different place.  This would allow people to get around without using cars."
4361,19,86,['bicycle'],"I think it would be cool if there were kisoks you could rent bicycles from.  Maybe put a gps tracker inside of them so people didn't try to steal them, or give people back part of their deposit when they returned the bike to another kisok."
4362,19,86,['bicycle'],"I wish we had separate bicycle highways that were enclosed spaces, both heated and cooled for summer/winter. It would be a cheaper mode of transportation. There would be protection to prevent car vs bicycle accident, a major problem in our area. It would also be healthier and exercise for the day during a commute. I picture it being a rounded space that is clear so you can see your surroundings outside."
4363,19,86,['bicycle'],"I would create a bicycle rental system that was accessible to wheelchair. Pittsburgh created rental bicycles, but they left out disabled adults."
4364,19,86,['bicycle'],"I would like to see a bicycle highway.  It would go the length of regular highways, but be for bikes and pedestrians.  It should be wide enough for fast moving road cyclist, it should have passing lanes, and little road crossings.  There should be frequent on and off ramps.  There should also be many large parking areas.  Ideally it would even lead to public transportation areas with ample bike parking."
4365,19,86,['bicycle'],"I would like to see public transportation on buses expanded in my area, with a dedicated area for bicycles to also be transported on the buses.  This would help a lot with traffic, and still allow people to get to their destinations quickly."
4366,19,86,['bicycle'],"Imagine streets that are great for bicycling, walking, taking transit and just for enjoying in our neighborhood"
4367,19,86,['bicycle'],"In my neighborhood, any public transportation would  be new. We could make rentable bicycles that are in a convenient location"
4368,19,86,['bicycle'],"In the downtown area, stations to rent bicycles or even mopeds. Maybe you could have a really cheap membership and present your card at the check out station. Then you would return it at another check out station. It would cut down on how much people use cars. The key would be having enough stations to actually get the bike or moped to make the idea viable."
4369,19,86,['bicycle'],IT SHOULD BE BICYCLE. BECAUSE IT DOESNOT CREATE POLLUTION AND OUR CHOLESTROL LEVEL TO BE NORMAL.
4370,19,86,['bicycle'],It would be great if there was a scooter share like there is with bicycles. Something where you swipe your credit card and drop it off at any station thats convenient to you.
4371,19,86,['bicycle'],"it'd be cool to have a rent a shop throughout the city for people who aren't able to afford bicycles or scooters, or any other sort of transportations. the can rent an item, and return it at the other part of town."
4372,19,86,['bicycle'],It's an elevated covered roadway somewhat similar to elevated train tracks but it's for bicycles and it has a bunch of fans to provide an artificial tailwind to provide a speed comparable to cars in a congested urban setting.
4373,19,86,['bicycle'],make more busses available with more bicycle carrying capacity
4374,19,86,['bicycle'],"Many people in my town already ride bicycles to and from work or to run errands, and quite frankly I wish more of them would.  I live on a peninsula, so everyone is always competing for parking anyway.  I think bicycles are ideal for commuting in a smallish town like mine."
4375,19,86,['bicycle'],Motorized bicycles that can be 'borrowed' much like places that have normal bicycles. You fill it with fuel when you are done so it is ready for next user.
4376,19,86,['bicycle'],"My city is a little small and close together. Most people use a car or the bus. I think it would be a great idea if more people rode bicycles, and I don't think it would take much longer to get where they need to go."
4377,19,86,['bicycle'],My idea is a bicycle that has a solar panel covered frame so that when you are riding it the energy that comes into the solar panels is stored in a battery that you can use to power your phones or other electronics. The battery is also easily transportable so that you can take it with you into your office/home to power other electronics inside as well.
4378,19,86,['bicycle'],My Idea would be to make the alleyways in my city a lot more bike friendly.  Honestly they are very rarely ever used by the city or homeowners so to make them this way would be beneficial for so many others. This would I believe encourage more people to use bicycles since I know I am terrified when riding my bicycle next to extremely lage and fast moving automobile traffic on my cities roads and highways.
4379,19,86,['bicycle'],"My town is in desparate need of a form of public transportation. Everyone is reliant on a car or scooter. I think they don't have enough need to  warrant a bus route, but I'm in favor of widening the tiny bicycle lanes they have."
4380,19,86,['bicycle'],"Not just in my neighborhood but metro-wide, my city recently established time share bicycles people can rent and ride when they have a short distance to travel. The bikes are all of the same design, having a large sturdy frame painted light blue, three gears (the gear box is inside the rear wheel axle, and LED blinker lights for safety. Necessarily, it's a one-size-fits-all arrangement; there's no way to raise or lower the seat unless you carry your own tools around with you, so if you're a tall person and use one of these bikes you'll be knocking yourself in the chin with your knees."
4381,19,86,['bicycle'],"People could ride bicycles to work, it would help as it would be good exercise. It could also be fun to do something different, as most others drives cars or trucks. However it could only for for close workplaces, as a lot of work is further then in bicycling distance."
4382,19,86,['bicycle'],Perhaps a system where you can rent out bicycles or motorbikes to get to where you need to go. You could hold a lot of them in one area and make it easy to check out the bike and then return it later. It would help getting around for people who can't afford a car service to take them around the city but also for people who prefer to be health conscious and also want to save money by biking around the city.
4383,19,86,['bicycle'],"Publicly available bicycles could be stationed at different regions of the town: different parts of the University campus, the downtown square, the region of stores and malls for shopping. This would allow students to be able to rent and use a bike to get around without having to own one and worry about its safety."
4384,19,86,['bicycle'],"Really enjoyable survey, I remember something to share here, All over the world is polluting by this transport. unnecessary transport are more, we need to educate bi-cycle to use for transporting, but it never happens. Since, Government is not working for people, here these days government are not for the people, they work for them. so they make illegal money by encouraging unnecessary transport with the corporate. We sooner loose everything natural things. we must encourage our own people to use bicycle for unnecessary transports, so that we will be healthy by using bicycle and we can make nature pollution free."
4385,19,86,['bicycle'],Rentable bicycles.  Two or three locations where individuals can rent and return bicycles for a small fee.  The locations probably don't even need someone to watched the bikes if there is some kind of gps locater built in and a cash/credit operated locking mechanism.

4396,19,86,['bicycle'],"Some sort of free bicycle rides.  It would work by having you use a credit card (so people cannot steal bicycles) as a deposit.   Here's how it would work.  You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.    If you don't return the bike, it would charge your card aka ask for a retransmission of said packet.  That's all I have for now."
4397,19,86,['bicycle'],Stalls that allow people to rent and drop off bicycles so they can get around the city without wasting gas and causing pollution. Implant GPS devices inside the bikes so they can't be stolen.
4398,19,86,['bicycle'],The idea is that free long term parking is offered at multiple nodes throughout the outskirts of the city. Within the city there are three primary modes of transport: public bicycles (if needed) for short distances between bus stops for medium distances and at key points throughout the city train stations for the longest stretches for cross city travel.
4399,19,86,['bicycle'],"the sidewalks should move, and there should be bicycle lanes that move as well so that you can move on the double via the moving roads' motion and the bicycles' motion"
4400,19,86,['bicycle'],"There are many parts of my area that aren't accessible by foot or bicycle; in order to get from one section of town to another, you have to take a highway, where only motorized vehicles area allowed. This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
4401,19,86,['bicycle'],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
4402,19,86,['bicycle'],There should be government funding to give everyone bicycles.
4403,19,86,['bicycle'],There would be a pay-to-use bicycle system similar to the Citi bicycles in New York City. It would allow people to exercise while getting to their location quickly. It would also relieve traffic congestion.
4404,19,86,['bicycle'],"This is a transportation system that delivers food directly to people's houses. It exists in a large city and people will use an App on their phones to get food delivered to their house. They can enter the restaurant, find out what they want, and someone will deliver the food item by any mean they choose whether it be car or bicycle or walking. The app will also store people's favorite orders at their restaurants so they don't have to think about what to order."
4405,19,86,['bicycle'],"This is about a single user system. It is similar to a bicycle. But it's does not run on road. It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable. We take it from home or rent from government."
4406,19,86,['bicycle'],This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.

4410,19,86,['bicycle'],"ROAD TRANSPORT - BICYCLE (GOOD EXERCISE FOR OUR WHOLE BODY, LOW COST AND NO POLLUTION."
4411,19,86,['bicycle'],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
4412,20,77,['station'],"A bus that is programed to do the fastest route possible for what people need. There is a station where they push their destination, and a program figurs out who needs to go where and the best way to do it. Reduces wait time and makes more people want to use it."
4413,20,77,['station'],"A large network of rails traveling from downtown to every other part part of the surrounding area featuring energy efficient, sleek that arrive every ten to twenty minutes at each station"
4414,20,77,['station'],"A light rail from city center to neighboring suburbs that would replace thousands of commuters and make rush hours less crowded and stressful. This could be as simple as one station in each suburb (thus 10-15 total stations), or a more complex system with multiple stations in each suburb."
4415,20,77,['station'],A motorized scooter program where  you can rent them from stations throughout the city.
4416,20,77,['station'],"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
4417,20,77,['station'],A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be rentable bicycle stations! They would be scattered all over the city.  You would simply put change into a machine or swipe a credit card and a bike would unlock.  You could then use it to ride all over the city.  You could return it to any other rental rack.  The racks would also have hand sanitizers and wipes so you could wipe down the public bikes before using them.  This would greatly reduce gas and emissions in the city and people would get good exercise biking around!
4418,20,77,['station'],A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
4419,20,77,['station'],A rent a bike system. Solar powered bikes could be rented for 1$ and returned at different stations for a refund of 1$.
4420,20,77,['station'],A station with a tube in the ground with a high speed pod that would shoot me at a quick speed across the city or across the country in a couple hours. It would be faster than an airplane and safer too.
4421,20,77,['station'],"A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."
4422,20,77,['station'],A system of mopeds that you leave at different stations and ride around on only paying to rent them
4423,20,77,['station'],A tram system that is operated by a robot where you can stop as you please and not at stations
4424,20,77,['station'],"A trolley system would be a great source of transportation, using small trolleys instead of buses.  Another Idea would be a mini bus system that primarily transported people to key areas like the train station or the airport.  A shuttle system."
4425,20,77,['station'],"Although nationwide there has been a rise in alternative fuel sources, there is absolutely no support for that in my city. I think there should be an alternative fueling station installed to get people interested in adopting these technologies, and to show local support for the progressive idea."
4426,20,77,['station'],"An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
4427,20,77,['station'],"An idea for getting around my city would be public Segways or other riding devices that you could take from station to station and plug back into a machine to charge up.  Obviously, anti-theft measures would have to be in place, but this could be really great in helping people get around."
4428,20,77,['station'],"An underground Seqway track which will take a while to build but will be extremely beneficial. There are no turns as underground paths are completely straight. Recharger stations are at every mile or two. There are practically no intersections or traffic lights except at major hubs, which are few and far between. Delivery services such as mail and UPS are a major component of this transportation system, which will make them faster and clear up traffic on major roads."
4429,20,77,['station'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."

4434,20,77,['station'],Charging station for electric cars that also has lots of electronic device chargeers.
4435,20,77,['station'],Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
4436,20,77,['station'],extremely light rail. People hop into 1 person rail cars that take up less room than a bike lane. There would be no waiting at the rail station because it leaves as soon as you get in.
4437,20,77,['station'],"Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
4438,20,77,['station'],"High speed trains to commute into Chicago from various cities throughout northwest Indiana, with sleek train stations that include lots of amenities (coffee shops, dry cleaning, etc.)"
4439,20,77,['station'],"Hoverboard/Segway share: have stations located around the neighborhood where a hoverboard or a segway can be left to charge and then someone else can use it, leaving it at another station for someone else to use."

I would like a people-mover sort of system that travels through the neighborhood making the existing metro station more accessible. Perhaps small cars or pods at the end of each street that travel along an elevated rail directly to the metro station."
4442,20,77,['station'],"I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city. Would take ten minutes max to board and 10-15 minutes to go downtown."
4443,20,77,['station'],"I think high-speed tube travel would be great in my city. The tubes could be a system of plastic or rubber tubes that were buried underground. There would be a lot of tube stations downtown, but they would branch off to the outer city and suburbs. These tubes would have pods in them that were propelled by high-pressured air. The pods could be designed to carry one or two people each, and would be shot through the tubes for quick travel to your destination."
4444,20,77,['station'],I think we could bring back the streetcar in queens where the subway has low coverage. The streetcar would connect to the subway system which would be entirely rebuilt to accommodate new clean stations with solar panels and zero carbon foot print. This would connect with commuter and regional trains that would operate on an hourly scale.
4445,20,77,['station'],I would have the Metro system extended further into Virginia to lessen the commute time.  I would also call for train stations that were more accessible and uses solar energy predominantly.
4446,20,77,['station'],I would imagine an electric scooter or hoverboard rental system.  You could use them when going to and from a train station stop and to your final destination.  I imagine a rental system so that you could pick one up at a train or bus station to go your extra distance and return it when you return.  Renting would be a good option if you did not have your own with you or only use it with other public transportation. Bad weather is always an issue using these devices.
4447,20,77,['station'],I would like to see a high speed train connect all the major cities in my state as well as the major cities bordering our state.  I envision this high speed train to have minimal stations.  This would eliminate the need for air travel and long road trips.
4448,20,77,['station'],"I would like to see a system built around ""people movers"" - similar to the ride that was once at Disneyland.  It would run underneath the ground - under the traffic.  Each car would hold one or two people with large reclining chairs and a docking station for your laptop so you can watch movies, play games or actually do work."
4449,20,77,['station'],"I would like to see lightrail or street cars inbny neighbor hood.   Something that was powered in part by alternative energy.  Solar panels on the stations, perhaps on top of the light rail cars."
4450,20,77,['station'],"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
4451,20,77,['station'],"I would love individual Segway transporters that would go from the house to the transit station.  They would just fit one person and keep them dry.  Only about 1 mile but just far enough in the rain not to walk.  Once at the transit station, the train takes you directly every 5 minutes into the city."
4452,20,77,['station'],"In my area, we don't have buses or sidewalks. You HAVE to drive a car, even though the area is big enough for a bus. I would love to have an eco-friendly bus route through the main part of town. 



One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."
4453,20,77,['station'],"In the downtown area, stations to rent bicycles or even mopeds. Maybe you could have a really cheap membership and present your card at the check out station. Then you would return it at another check out station. It would cut down on how much people use cars. The key would be having enough stations to actually get the bike or moped to make the idea viable."
4454,20,77,['station'],In the future we could develop a pod system that takes each person directly to the place they want to go.  A pod station could be set up and all you do is type the address of the location where you want to go and it takes you there in seconds.  This would require some infrastructure and technology to build.
4455,20,77,['station'],"It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
4456,20,77,['station'],"It would be better if the government will create a new transpo scheme wherein there will be a separate lane for buses, a separate late wherein it is closed for every other vehicle and there are stations for the customers just like in train/subway system, card system will be used in the stations estimated time of the next bus arrival shown on screen and it can also be checked through a mobile app"
4457,20,77,['station'],It would be great if there was a scooter share like there is with bicycles. Something where you swipe your credit card and drop it off at any station thats convenient to you.
4458,20,77,['station'],"It would be great to have a bike share program in my neighborhood. Just have a couple bike lock stations and have the city get us a bunch of bikes, and just use the bikes as we need them and park then when we're done."
4459,20,77,['station'],"Monorail through the city! Just like Disneyland, this city-wide system allows you to see the city from a bird's eye! Simply get on at one of the many stations around town and enjoy your ride without stops, traffic or bad weather. The rails above the city means growth can continue without getting in the way of transport, and means you can watch the world below!"
4460,20,77,['station'],Moving sidewalks would help people get to the train station more smoothly.
4461,20,77,['station'],"My idea is a combination of self driving cars, rideshare and a train. Commuters would pay for a ticket and a line of connected self driving cars would take commuters going the same route/direction to a certain dropoff point, like a train does. Then when the string of cars reaches the stop point, each passenger can enter their desired destination into the touchpad screen in the car and they would be driven to their individual destinations. The self driving cars would break off individually from the train to take these passengers, then they'd return on their own to the ""train station"" to go pick up more passengers."
4462,20,77,['station'],"My neighborhood currently has no bike lanes, so I would imagine a system with renewable transportation integrated into the layout. Spaces for bikes, electric car re-charging stations, etc."
4463,20,77,['station'],"my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops. People will be able to travel to any part of the world without going through airports and flight connections. There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
4464,20,77,['station'],"My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
4465,20,77,['station'],Now Houston already have public bike stations. These stations allow someone to check out a bike for the day for a small fee. In some other cities someone has the choice to rent a car for the day using a credit card . The cars are eco friendly and cost very little to rent. I'm not talking about CarMax. This service is similar to the same service that is offered to rent bikes here in Houston. I think Houston should think about bringing the idea to the city .
4466,20,77,['station'],"Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."
4467,20,77,['station'],Paying a fee for a bike that could be used monthly. There would be multiple stations set up where you could place the bike and switch out for others.
4468,20,77,['station'],"Public skype/facetime stations in major transportation hubs (bus or train stations, airports)."
4469,20,77,['station'],"Publicly available bicycles could be stationed at different regions of the town: different parts of the University campus, the downtown square, the region of stores and malls for shopping. This would allow students to be able to rent and use a bike to get around without having to own one and worry about its safety."
4470,20,77,['station'],RAILWAYS-Railways is one of the most largest under single management.It carries some 18 million passengers and 2 million tons of freight a day and is one of the worldÃ¢s largest employer.The railways play a leading role in carrying passengers and cargo across Indias vast territory. There are almost 8000 railway stations in the country.
4471,20,77,['station'],"Rent a scooter in the summer. These would be like the automatic bike rental stations in many cities, only you'd rent rechargable electric scooters. Station would charge them"
4472,20,77,['station'],Rental electrical bike stations near the bus stops.  You can check out a bike like you were at a library.
4473,20,77,['station'],Scooter rental stations. Rent one for a period of time and return at next station.
4474,20,77,['station'],Segway rental stations placed all over the neighborhood.  Just rent out a segway for a given amount of time and return it to the nearest station when finished with use.  Segways are relatively low profile and can easily be used by most people.
4475,20,77,['station'],"Segways everywhere, that you can rent and park at multiple stations. Sort of like how some places do this with bicycles, but with some kind of GPS thing that would make it useless outside a certain radius, to avoid theft. Also make them trackable, in case someone decides to try to take one home to disable that GPS chip."
4476,20,77,['station'],"Shared bike system - everyone has access to a system of bicycles that are evenly distributed throughout the city via ""bike parking lots."" Punch in a code, get a bike for the day, return it to another station later."
4477,20,77,['station'],"Similar to the idea of car ride sharing, there could be bike sharing. This already exists on some level, but those bikes are terrible and slow. The bikes could be outfitted with an electric motor, and the motors could be charged via solar panels at the bike stations. This way, people would be more inclined to use them because it would be really easy to get up the hills around here."
4478,20,77,['station'],Solar powered golf carts. You could have stations kind of like bikes and check them out and return them.
4479,20,77,['station'],Some type of underground or above-ground monorail system to help with the massive traffic problem in my area. With stations in key locations that are unobtrusive to the overall community.
4480,20,77,['station'],"Subways with shorter runs. NYC is filled with unused tunnels and stations. Get them up and running. Also, allow people who use any sort of wheel-based transport, that's not a bus or car, to use the bike lanes."
4481,20,77,['station'],"Taken from the idea of bike rentals, there should also be motorized scooters available for rental, where you can rent any motorized scooter from a ""station"" and return it to another ""station"" around your area when you are done."
4482,20,77,['station'],"Taxi-style self-driving cars which can be summoned via app and hired for longer journeys, or which would at least serve rural areas. Cars would probably have to be stationed at depots on the outskirts of town, activating and driving off when pinged."
4483,20,77,['station'],The idea is that free long term parking is offered at multiple nodes throughout the outskirts of the city. Within the city there are three primary modes of transport: public bicycles (if needed) for short distances between bus stops for medium distances and at key points throughout the city train stations for the longest stretches for cross city travel.
4484,20,77,['station'],The idea of having only driverless cars. No one will own a car. You just send a message through a driverless car app. The car closest to you will come pick you up. The cars will also have the ability to carpool (picking up people going in the same direction). The cars should also have the ability to go to a gas station on their own.
4485,20,77,['station'],The subway station can be replaced with magnetic levitation train. The subway train use electrically charged magnets to lift and move above the rail tracks.
4486,20,77,['station'],"There should be a free bus that runs from several locations (school, downtown, etc) to the train station on a loop all day and weekend. People would be able to hop on and off with ease."
4487,20,77,['station'],This idea uses the sky!  A station or helipad is set up and an aircraft is used that utilizes wing and rotors. Basically a cheaper and a bit smaller helicopter.  This is ideal in my opinion as it is a vertical takeoff which takes far less space than a runway.
4488,20,77,['station'],"We would ride hovercraft to a monorail station. The monorail would take us to work, school, etc."
4489,21,68,['location'],"A bicycle rental system that allows town-owned bicycles to be ""checked out"" at various locations throughout the city, and returned to any of several locations. This will encourage people to ride bikes, even if they do not own them themselves."
4490,21,68,['location'],"A both walking and bike lane that provides safety from traffic, is well lit, and connects key locations around the neighborhood."
4491,21,68,['location'],A crowd-sourced bus stop app. Instead of having fixed bus stops throughout the city. People through a smart phone app request a bus to stop at a certain locations. This would provide information to the bus service company in improving the locations and times of where service is needed the most.
4492,21,68,['location'],A drone taxi that picks you up and drops you off at your desired location.
4493,21,68,['location'],A map that has the location of buses currently running so that you can see how long it takes for your bus to reach you while waiting for the bus.
4494,21,68,['location'],"A motorized scooter ""stop.""  Basically a few very popular areas you can pick up a scooter from an agent.  Credit is the only thing that's acceptable, as they need to have something on file in case you ride off with the scooter.  These locations where you can both rent, and return scooters will only be in very popular areas (Such as the mall, a large amount of business buildings, and the like.)  Make it relatively affordable, and have people be able to write it off as an expense."
4495,21,68,['location'],"A network of self driving cars on demand.  You set your pickup time and location via app, as well as destination and desired arrival time."
4496,21,68,['location'],A new transportation system for our neighborhood could be shared scooters.  The scooters would be open for all to use and stocked at locations around the neighborhood.  You could check them out and return them for less money than the cost of a scooter.
4497,21,68,['location'],"A overhanging monorail. There are a lot of key locations close together, this would be great for my town."
4498,21,68,['location'],"A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
4499,21,68,['location'],A zip line system above the ground that brings people to schools and event locations. This would be a fun innovate way to get people from one location to another.
4500,21,68,['location'],"An app that worked somewhat like Uber, but is for ride-sharing/car pooling.  You put in your destination, whether you can drive or not, what time you need to be to your destination, and an acceptable range for the location.  The app would look for others with similar destinations or destinations en-route for others as well as the best route to minimize drive time, but maximize people getting to their destination.  Then the app would calculate a fair percentage of the ride cost for each person based on their destination, travel distance, etc.  Public transportation here isn't great because we are so spread out.  After each ride you could rate other passengers and the driver and those ratings could be used to filter out bad users entirely or just below a certain rating level."
4501,21,68,['location'],An idea for a new transportation system in my neighborhood would be to use cars with automated driving that would allow the person(s) to input the destination and go about doing other things while the car drove itself to that location.
4502,21,68,['location'],An on demand bicycle system where a truck (with a trailer?) will bring a bicycle to your current location and then you can leave it in place when you're done. Reservations could be made in advance using an app.
4503,21,68,['location'],"An uber-like system for public transit busses. Riders must request pick up 24 hours ahead of time, and the bus would come to their door or as close as it could to pick the rider up. The fare could be determined by how many riders requested pick up, and drop off to a central location (downtown). From there maybe there would be additional busses that go directly to drop off points rather than on a pre-set route."
4504,21,68,['location'],"App integrated public & private transport, using location services in smartphones to sync to trains, buses, taxis, Ubers Zipcars etc to streamline travel. Using a global integrated app to pay for any type of transport service"
4505,21,68,['location'],"As a former city dweller who is now car-less in suburbia, I dream of a system of autonomous cars. The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."
4506,21,68,['location'],Buses are the best.  The best thing would be way more bus stops so we don't have to walk as far.  it would be even better to have longer hours that they are running.  maybe an app could tell the driver to stop at specific locations where someone is ready to be picked up instead of at traditional bus stops.  that would be great.
4507,21,68,['location'],Carpooling: An app can be developed that gives location and destination and time of departure so that people in proximity can click in app to book their seat in the going car.
4508,21,68,['location'],Cars that can connect their GPS's so when they are all going to similar locations they can switch on auto drive and so all the computers can drive automatically. Once the closest stop comes around it'll make it so you have to drive the rest of the way.
4509,21,68,['location'],Developing a bike path throughout the neighborhood that goes directly to business locations would encourage more people to ride bikes and drive their cars less.  This bike path could snake all around the city with entries directly to all business locations making it an easy option for people.
4510,21,68,['location'],Each neighborhood gets together to say what time they will be leaving that has a automatic system that will call and tell everyone in the neighborhood or in short distance where they are going and when they are leaving.  That way they can catch a ride with others and not have to guess where or when they are leaving. It could be like a carpool system where everywhere you go it will auto call if that person is gong to another location and you still have room in your vehicle.
4511,21,68,['location'],"First off, that's a really choppy question.



There could be a network of ride sharing. Sort of like if Uber was a bus. People would have a regular route and others would request a ride to a central location. It would be mostly people commuting to work together. This would be done through phone apps."
4512,21,68,['location'],Free bike exchange drop off type situation with buy in.  I'd like to pay a small fee to get a key to buy into a bike exchange that would be availible outside a number of locations spread thoughout the small city to use when i wish.
4513,21,68,['location'],Group carpools to work.  There could be an app that puts you in contact with people who work at the same company you work at or in close proximity to your work location.  The app would allow drivers to sign up to drive to work and with a rotating schedule this would cut down the amount of driving that any one single person would have to do.
4514,21,68,['location'],"Having charter buses pick you up from designated spots around the city and dropping you off in various locations around, such as the mall, groceries etc."
4515,21,68,['location'],"How about color coded cars that only service a particular area for a flat rate. As the car takes a passenger to desired location within that particular area, if another person flags that same colored car, that person can hop in and share the ride. After all, the drop off points will be in the same general area and the rate is flat."
4516,21,68,['location'],"I get out of my house and before I leave my apartment on my 12th floor I just press a button on my app on my phone to type a location of the place i need to go.This would in turn contact all local data base systems of GPS based transport systems irrespective of the vendors available or government supported transport systems which include Cabs,Buses,Trains,Subway,3 Wheelers and most importantly assuming the people of the future will care a lot more about the environment and all the people who are going alone in a 5 seater car would have a option of sharing there carbon footprint left by the vehicle.And if the co-ordinates of the person with the car and the co-ordinates of the Person who is using the app matches then a Random Unique (one time use)Number or Picture or Anything which would be visible from atleast 10 feet away on a Min 6 inch screen.However this interface can be avoided by tracking the dots on the GPS system or by sending a snap shot of the car number or a photo of the person himself which will be destroyed automatically by the system once the person is down from the Vehicle.Punch Line Before I get to the main gates of the apartment.I should have the list of Vehicles available to me and the time it would take the vehicle to reach my place based on GPS and traffic conditions and also how much time would it take to reach my destination again based on real time traffic conditions and also most importantly.if i take  the public transport system.How much time would it take to reach the same destination and also how much Carbon foot print would i save from doing it.And also the time required by the vehicle to reach the local transport systems if it is not a walkable distance.There are many more ,But i think that is enough for the day.

GIVE THE CUSTOMER ALL THE POSSIBLE OPTIONS OF COMMUTING WITH THE CARBON FOOTPRINT AND THE COST AND THE TIME INVOLVED IRRESPECTIVE OF THE VENDOR OR GOVERNMENT SYSTEMS..."
4517,21,68,['location'],I imagine a way to ride a school bus to various spots on its route. You would be pre-screened as an adult who could act as a school bus monitor and at the same time gain transportation to a location near the school. It would solve the problem of kids riding unsupervised and give another public transportation option in the neighborhood.
4518,21,68,['location'],I live in a town right on the ocean and there are many canals here. I think a canoe taxi service would be really convenient and fun. It wouldn't get people to their desired locations super fast but it would allow people to travel leisurely and enjoy the scenery along the way. It would also be really healthy for the people driving the canoes and help them to stay fit.
4519,21,68,['location'],I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
4520,21,68,['location'],"I would like an interchangeable form of light rail, in which the train would have several compartments that would be destined for multiple locations. That way you just get on the train, and the train goes to an interchange. At the interchange the compartments are separated (I imagine they are held together by magnets) and grouped together by location. Once all the compartments that are going to the same area are together, the train leaves. It would work like changing trains, except you wouldn't have to go outside."
4521,21,68,['location'],"I would like to have a subterranean network of moving roller coaster type tracks that move people to any location in the city easily, and deliver them right to the door step of where they need to go. This could be done by having exit points from the underground network of tracks that bring you to specific address clusters."
4522,21,68,['location'],"I would like to see a short-term car rental service with semi-autonomous driving. For example, if I needed to go to the airport and didn't want to leave my current car in a parking lot their I could rent a car that I could summon with a smartphone app. The car would be able autonomously drive directly to me or a location I choose through the app. After I was at the location of my choosing and no longer needed the car, I could then use the app to send the car away."
4523,21,68,['location'],"I'd use apps and social media so I know the times of all transport.  If it's late, I don't want to hang out too long. An app would pick up my location and show the times of the buses or street car. I could set it to warn me too."
4524,21,68,['location'],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"
4525,21,68,['location'],In my neighborhood it would be like a monorail system. Something that you could get on at one stop and take it to another are you would want to go. Connecting locations you would visit.
4526,21,68,['location'],"In my neighborhood, any public transportation would  be new. We could make rentable bicycles that are in a convenient location"
4527,21,68,['location'],In the future we could develop a pod system that takes each person directly to the place they want to go.  A pod station could be set up and all you do is type the address of the location where you want to go and it takes you there in seconds.  This would require some infrastructure and technology to build.
4528,21,68,['location'],"In the future, self driving cabs can be summoned via mobile phone, to pick up the driver and take them to a particular destination via a touchscreen or other similar interface located inside the vehicle.  Some difficulty may occur if the passenger is unsure of the address of his or her destination, but a trained attendant can be called to determine the location for the passenger."
4529,21,68,['location'],It would be an app that allows people to call in helicopters to their location. It would let them call a helicopter to where they live and be transported from there.
4530,21,68,['location'],It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.
4531,21,68,['location'],"My city is right on the ocean and there are many canals within the city as well, so I think a kind of transportation system with water taxis or some kind of water buses would be really useful. In a lot of cases I think this kind of transportation would be faster and more accessible to people, especially if it was willing to pick people up at designated locations or even right off their own docks for those who have them."
4532,21,68,['location'],My idea is to build an app for uber drivers that show all the short cuts to a location. Even if they have to drive through residential areas. The app will calculate the shortest distance and time depending on traffic.
4533,21,68,['location'],"People not owning private vehicles, but could summon a vehicle for use though a computer or smartphone to their location. The vehicle would take them where they need to go.

4540,21,68,['location'],"Some sort of free bicycle rides.  It would work by having you use a credit card (so people cannot steal bicycles) as a deposit.   Here's how it would work.  You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.    If you don't return the bike, it would charge your card aka ask for a retransmission of said packet.  That's all I have for now."

This would let people have cars pick them up at whatever location they want and have the car autonomously drive to their destination. Similar to a fleet of self driving electric taxis. This would greatly reduce the cost of transportation in my opinion because people would not have to buy cars but could rather rent or lease them.

Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"

4564,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
4565,22,27,"['system', 'subway']",Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
4566,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
4567,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","Having some sort of electric train that runs underground, just like the subway system in New York. The city that I currently live in doesn't have that option so having some sort of underground transportation system that runs all around the city constantly would make commuting much better for everyone."
4568,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","I am from Cincinnati, and one new mode of transportation that would be great here is a subway system. Tunnels already exist from a failed project decades ago, but with the growth the city has seen, it could be a viable option."
4569,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
4570,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","I live in a town with a lot of freight trains. A subway system would be nice because it would get us places faster (the town is large in size and spread out over several miles) and be able to bypass the trains, which stop constantly. The subway would run either over the existing trains or under them and run off of cards that were prepaid like the MTAs."
4571,22,27,"['system', 'subway']",I think that we need a rail system for our city. Its a growing city with lost of bigger cities around it. A main rail system like a subway would make things much easier to get from place to place.
4572,22,27,"['system', 'subway']",I think we could bring back the streetcar in queens where the subway has low coverage. The streetcar would connect to the subway system which would be entirely rebuilt to accommodate new clean stations with solar panels and zero carbon foot print. This would connect with commuter and regional trains that would operate on an hourly scale.
4573,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
4574,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
4575,22,27,"['system', 'subway']",It would be amazing if we had a subway in my city. It would go to good use and people would use cars less. Everyone drives around here because the bus system is lacking and public transport is difficult. We would benefit from a subway system.
4576,22,27,"['system', 'subway']",my city needs a subway system badly. A subway system would run in a star shaped pattern through the city and eliminate the terrible traffic in my city
4577,22,27,"['system', 'subway']","My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

4625,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","A magnetic roadway system, where people move in modular pods that are controlled by a central operating system (COS). Magnets underneath the street guide your pod along, and every movement of all of the pods is controlled perfectly by the computerized system, it is completely autonomous. If your whole family wants to go into town, you assemble your four-pod system and take off, where traffic is optimized perfectly by the COS. If just you are on your way to work, you hop in your single passenger pod, and take off!"
4626,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","A new transportation system in my neighborhood could be the use of drones to fly individuals in and around town, or to far off destinations. The drones would fly like helicopters, but can  can also be controlled using a remote control. Unlike a car which can transport several passengers, the drone would be only be able to transport one person."
4627,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","A pod/train system that runs on the shoulder of roads. It would be more active than typical buses, and be more personal in that there can be no more than 4 passengers. It would run on a track or in the future it would would run with automatic sensing software and would drive itself."
4628,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","An automated system of cabs. Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."
4629,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']",Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
4630,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","Have a transportation system in the city where there is a tunneling system filled miniature train with small passenger capacity. These miniature trains can take people directly to their destination and the best part is that because they are small, there can be a large number of them running underneath the city."
4631,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","I am visually a bus like transportation system that travels on something like rails which are suspended from above.  The rails are not supported by concrete systems from below.  Specialized buses will travel on these rails without causing disruption of regular road traffic.  When it nears a bus stop, the bus will stop and drop itself down to the level of the regular roads, open the door and let the passengers in and out.  Once the door closes it will climb up to the to the level of the suspended rails and travel forward on the rails."
4632,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","I live near the water, so water transportation would be nice to have. It could be a system of ferries that can go from port to port, carrying passengers like a bus system. This would reduce the amount of cars on the road and the amount of traffic."
4633,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","I think a bullet train would be very useful. A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
4634,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']",I would like to see a modern underground railway system installed in my neighbourhood. It would be noiseless and very fast. The railway will connect all the neighbourhood together making it easier to move around. The train would be making stops every half hour  to pick up and drop passengers.
4635,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
4636,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
4637,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","My idea for public transportation would include an underground rail system powered by magnets. Because of the varied climate as well as prevalence natural disasters in my area, having the system underground seems like the best idea. The train would stop a lot more often than normal trains; At the end of every street at least. It would have a separate exit system in order to not lose quite as much time loading and unloading passengers."
4638,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
4639,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","This new transportation system is a bullet train in the sky, able to span around the neighborhood with up to 700 passengers in under two minutes.

The rails float there in the sky, ready to carry this majestic beauty to the ends of the neighborhood making sure everyone is early"
4640,25,17,"['system', 'passenger']","This system would be made up of a continuous stream of drivers of small vehicles.  The vehicles might be three-wheelers or some other form of small, motorized vehicles.  Besides the driver, the vehicles would only have space for two other occupants.  The vehicles would continue on the same busy stretch of road.  In other words, they would be on a fixed path.  Also, there would be a large number of these vehicles, a constant stream, so the passenger would never have to wait longer than a minute or two.  The passengers would have prepaid for the service, so there would be no need to exchange money with the driver."

In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
4649,26,17,"['system', 'taxi']","I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it.

4652,26,17,"['system', 'taxi']","I would like to see an advanced transportation system that involved driverless cars.  The idea is the same as using a taxi but without a driver.  Like Uber, you would use your mobile device to order a car and control the experience.  The car shows up at your door, takes you to your destination and you are billed for the ride. It would save me thousands of dollars in the cost to own, maintain, insure and license my own personal car."
4653,26,17,"['system', 'taxi']","My city is right on the ocean and there are many canals within the city as well, so I think a kind of transportation system with water taxis or some kind of water buses would be really useful.

4654,26,17,"['system', 'taxi']","Scooters or bikes for rent put in areas that are too far to walk but for people who can't afford a car, uber, or taxi. You could rent them for a day and return them to the area that evening or keep them for another day's charge like a Redbox sort of system."
4655,26,17,"['system', 'taxi']",There needs to be a new system that picks you up at your place. A bus system that you can call to pick you up and the closest one will come. Kind of like a taxi but a bus so it can carry a lot more people.
4656,26,17,"['system', 'taxi']","This idea is called 'Rolling taxi'. The system is a large ball. single large ball. Inside the ball, people can sit . People sit or stand at the centre of the ball. As ball rolls on specially made road the centre region doesn't move. The centre region where people sit is attached to the  inner surface of the ball in a special manner so that people do not move.

It can go to individual streets and addresses because it needs no rails, but can use multiple-line systems to navigate the town. It makes scheduled stops, but can also be called by the app. It is free, paid for by local and state taxes, and very clean and quick. People use it for a wide variety of uses, from nights on the town, to grocery shopping, to work commute. It is very safe, clean and fun."

But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force.

Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient.

4727,31,12,"['system', 'route']","I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."

4729,31,12,"['system', 'route']","My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."

Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way.

Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car.

4946,49,10,"['car', 'subway']","My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

5008,57,7,"['car', 'fuel']",I'd like to see some sort of autonomous shared fleet of cars that are fueled in some sort of environmentally friendly way. Solar panels on the roof? Maybe bike pedaling inside if you want to exercise and provide a small amount of power? I feel like autonomous cars alone will save a ton of energy just by eliminating traffic jams. And cut down on wind resistance since you wouldn't need to keep the traditional design necessarily.
5009,57,7,"['car', 'fuel']","My mode of alternative transportation would include cars, buses, and trams running on solar energy in roadways. I'm unsure how it would work exactly, but if we could harness the power of the sun and build vehicles that have the panels either on them or in the tires it could remove the use of fossil fuels."
5010,58,7,"['car', 'monorail']","A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.  They would park their cars before entering the city, and use this quick system for getting around.  No more crowded, expensive parking in the city."
5011,58,7,"['car', 'monorail']","An alternative transport that would be excellent would be a monorail in my city.  It could be run with electricity, with many train cars, and go along the main north south route.  You could get almost anywhere in quickly and easily if it went along that route."
5012,58,7,"['car', 'monorail']","An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
5013,58,7,"['car', 'monorail']",Have a monorail system around town. It'll reduce pollution because people will have fun using it instead of driving their cars.
5014,58,7,"['car', 'monorail']",I think a monorail system or cable cars like you see on ski lifts would be quite useful. moving walkways enclosed in a plastic tunnel to protect from elements that would have heat or a/c depending on the season would be really cool as well.
5015,58,7,"['car', 'monorail']","I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
5016,58,7,"['car', 'monorail']","The area is very car-dependent, but a train or monorail going down the middle or above the main highways would be a great way to travel down the expressways and parkways without having to depend on a car."
5017,59,7,"['car', 'congestion']","An underground tunnel system just for people, bikes and mopeds.  The idea is that all the cars and congestion can stay up above and people can safely walk or transport themselves around without worrying about cars and busses getting in the way or being run over by them.  Every so often there is a ramp that allows you to exit, as well as natural light through grates and proper ventilation.  It would also be a great way to get around when it snows."
5018,59,7,"['car', 'congestion']","autonomous vehicles abound. there are shared autonomous vehicles that can be called by neighborhood members. you may travel to destinations within your town only. the cost is shared by real estate tax. the benefit is a drastic reduction in traffic congestion, as much fewer cars are needed."
5019,59,7,"['car', 'congestion']",Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
5020,59,7,"['car', 'congestion']",Helicopter based taxi that can be taken anywhere.  The roof tops will now be loading and unloading areas and it will free up car congestion.
5021,59,7,"['car', 'congestion']",I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.
5022,59,7,"['car', 'congestion']","I thought of a light rail and below-ground subway system could be transport people to and from a downtown arena we have here in metro Columbus, Ohio. Right now most people use cars and a few people use buses, but that's about it. Congestion could be decreased substantially provided people who normally commute by themselves to and from hockey games that take place two to three times a week. This would solve congestion issues on the nights where these games take place and reduce the need for a large amount of safety and security officers to direct traffic and play crowd control on weekends and Fridays."
5023,59,7,"['car', 'congestion']",The future of transportation in my city is by having self-automated driverless cars. They would reduce the amount of traffic congestion and reduce the number of car accidents.
5024,60,6,"['car', 'metro']","Have a business where drivers rent cars, for hours and not days. The cars can be electric cars. Make them the cheapest cars possible. Make it for around the metro area only - and have the credit card swiper built into the car itself. In other words If you rent three hours with the car, it goes dead until you pay for more time. If someone takes it out of the pre-defined boundaries  of the city the car goes dead. You would have these little rental kiosks set up all over the city."
5025,60,6,"['car', 'metro']","I live in a neighborhood near an excellent metro system, but not walkable to it. I would like a people-mover sort of system that travels through the neighborhood making the existing metro station more accessible.

5030,61,6,"['car', 'highway']","A system could allow cars to drive up to a rail station and be loaded onto a platform. It could be optional to have the driver stay inside for short trips or get out for longer trips. The platforms could then allow cars to be quickly transported along rail lines instead of having to consume fuel. These can be used on older less used rail tracks, making use of existing infrastructure and help clear traffic along busy highways."

As far as transportation though I wish the highways in the city acted like slotted cars, similar to trains in which in every highway entrance there would be a dedicated lane/railway for vehicles to travel at fast speeds like trains. This would reduce traffic and travel times."
5032,61,6,"['car', 'highway']",I imagine a type of highway for bicycles where people can use on and off ramps easily to reach their destination. They wont have to worry about cars since its a bike only highway system. it will get people to their destination quicker since they dont have to stop at traffic lights and watch out for pedestrians.
5033,61,6,"['car', 'highway']","I wish we had separate bicycle highways that were enclosed spaces, both heated and cooled for summer/winter. It would be a cheaper mode of transportation. There would be protection to prevent car vs bicycle accident, a major problem in our area. It would also be healthier and exercise for the day during a commute. I picture it being a rounded space that is clear so you can see your surroundings outside."
5034,61,6,"['car', 'highway']",I would love to see the use of self propelled equipment like hover boards and such used to help decrease emissions from cars. Highways and roads could be established just for such travelors. and we would also save money on gas

5039,62,19,"['city', 'speed']",A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
5040,62,19,"['city', 'speed']",A station with a tube in the ground with a high speed pod that would shoot me at a quick speed across the city or across the country in a couple hours. It would be faster than an airplane and safer too.
5041,62,19,"['city', 'speed']","An elevated wagon wheel shaped, high speed rail system would be excellent. The outer ring would be bi-directional allowing quick transport around the city. The spokes would be bi-directional and allow quick transport from inner and outer within the quadrants."

5045,62,19,"['city', 'speed']",I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
5046,62,19,"['city', 'speed']",I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
5047,62,19,"['city', 'speed']","I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
5048,62,19,"['city', 'speed']",I would like to see a high speed train connect all the major cities in my state as well as the major cities bordering our state.  I envision this high speed train to have minimal stations.  This would eliminate the need for air travel and long road trips.
5049,62,19,"['city', 'speed']","I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
5050,62,19,"['city', 'speed']",My city is currently looking at High Occupancy Travel toll lanes.  I've thought that a dedicated lane for buses or van pools would be an alternative that could let the car commuters see the speed at which these other options can get to work.  This would encourage the use of the bus / van pool options.
5051,62,19,"['city', 'speed']",My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
5052,62,19,"['city', 'speed']","This idea is called 'Rolling taxi'. The system is a large ball. single large ball. Inside the ball, people can sit . People sit or stand at the centre of the ball. As ball rolls on specially made road the centre region doesn't move. The centre region where people sit is attached to the  inner surface of the ball in a special manner so that people do not move. The speed and direction of the ball can control using technology. The ball roll all across the city with people inside on a special track. Speed is high and expense is less. Also it is fun."
5053,62,19,"['city', 'speed']","This might be only useful for some places, but it's better than none.  I think there should be a moving walkway for the most common areas of a town or city.  This way foot traffic can be consistent and the flow high.  Since it's fairly low speed there shouldn't be any injury issues and transferring is as easy as getting off the one walkway and on to another."

In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."

In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."

But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area.

Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new.

It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop."
5089,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']","it'd be cool to have a rent a shop throughout the city for people who aren't able to afford bicycles or scooters, or any other sort of transportations. the can rent an item, and return it at the other part of town."
5090,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']",Motorcycle/ Scooter IS VERY USEING IN THE CITY
5091,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']",our city is metro .population is a big problem there and traffic too .large no of people use public transport like trains and buses but also use scooter in large nos as its easy to go to places when there is lot of traffic on rads to avoid jams.
5092,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']","Rent a scooter in the summer. These would be like the automatic bike rental stations in many cities, only you'd rent rechargable electric scooters. Station would charge them"
5093,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']","Ride scooters to a local bus stop that. Houses scooters on the bus, up to 10 miles from house, to work in the inner city, (25 miles from bus stop) it would save gas and pollution, instead of 25 people driving take a bus. Scooters get better Mpg and it's safer to stay on a bus on a highway than a scooter."
5094,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']",Scooter would be great transportation for college kids and busy cities.
5095,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']",There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.
5096,65,13,"['city', 'scooter']","we need individual stand up scooters for citys almost like the 2 wheeled ones we have now but run on electric under the road, or even like personal unicycles that take people around. totally different topic how about Walmart allows you to make your shopping list online and they drop it off at your house on routes city distribution"

5098,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']",A public taxi system dedicated to public transportation.  Standard operating hours and funded through taxes.  On demand pick up via city based app.  Essentially eliminating everyday drivers.
5099,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","A sort of rail line, but it's a single rail and has many hanging carts. The carts hold maybe 4 people at a time, like a taxi. The price would be cheaper than a bus and they would arrive quickly when you need them. You could push a button on poles that are located around the city, far more often than bus stops, and the cart will come to you quickly and take you directly to your destination. No need for bus drivers or waiting for traffic!"
5100,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."
5101,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","Automated taxi service. Would have several dispatch stations in key areas of city. Person could call for a ride from an app on their phone and it would send a car to them. The software could calculate rate for the trip and make you pay before as a confirmation before sending a car out. Car could then drive customer to said destination.  Self driveable cars that could provide a much better service than the often RUDE cab drivers could provide. Plus, I trust a robot way more than some of these morons driving!"
5102,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
5103,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']",I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
5104,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","I think the idea of rickshaws are a good one.  But in most places, like cities or suburban areas with hills, a traditional rickshaw wouldn't be practical.  I think that a bike with an electric motor and a cab on the back would be a good solution.  It's nicer for the environment and a more personal connection than a taxi.  Plus, traffic might be alleviated a bit since there's less cars on the road."
5105,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']",I would like to imagine being able to create a app and that uses credit cards. and invent a motorcycle scooter that has a huge row of seats in the back and runs like a mini van and use it as a taxi service. for only the city that I live in and name it Go Scooter transportation.
5106,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","I would love to see some kind of computer-operated taxi service in my city. The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
5107,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","My city is right on the ocean and there are many canals within the city as well, so I think a kind of transportation system with water taxis or some kind of water buses would be really useful. In a lot of cases I think this kind of transportation would be faster and more accessible to people, especially if it was willing to pick people up at designated locations or even right off their own docks for those who have them."
5108,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']",pod like stock cars for city that run on electric. They can be in routes and be like taxis but driverless.
5109,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","The city could do a partial co pay or cheap taxi or destination bus service. as in you meet the bus at a specific pick up place but then you tell the address you want, no designated stop."
5110,66,13,"['city', 'taxi']","This idea is called 'Rolling taxi'. The system is a large ball. single large ball. Inside the ball, people can sit . People sit or stand at the centre of the ball. As ball rolls on specially made road the centre region doesn't move. The centre region where people sit is attached to the  inner surface of the ball in a special manner so that people do not move. The speed and direction of the ball can control using technology. The ball roll all across the city with people inside on a special track. Speed is high and expense is less. Also it is fun."
5111,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","A mutli-layed monorail system that is solar and wind powered. I leave in las vegas, which has a centralized population. It would go up and down the strip and between the strip and downtown and around the city."
5112,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","City buses that actually go downtown and to the places that people need to go, instead of just around the edges of town. Also, have a fleet of bikes that people could rent for $1/hr to ride the distances downtown like some other cities."
5113,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","I imagine a train line that rings the entire city, with interstitial lines to service the downtown areas."
5114,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city. Would take ten minutes max to board and 10-15 minutes to go downtown."
5115,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","I think high-speed tube travel would be great in my city. The tubes could be a system of plastic or rubber tubes that were buried underground. There would be a lot of tube stations downtown, but they would branch off to the outer city and suburbs. These tubes would have pods in them that were propelled by high-pressured air. The pods could be designed to carry one or two people each, and would be shot through the tubes for quick travel to your destination."
5116,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","I want a monorail system to run above street level (may be 20 feet up or so).  I want it to connect the suburbs to downtown, and circle the city.  It would run on magnets so that it would be extremely quiet.  It would be extremely fast.  I want it to provide a bird's eye view for commuters.  It would be a very safe way to travel, crime and personal safety would not be an issue."
5117,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']",I would like our city to have a railway system like downtown Miami. Its computer operated and is over ground. This means it wont impact traffic at all. Its a fast and easy service and its going to make things easier for all.
5118,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']",I would like to see a cable car that runs across the city.  It would take people across the busy streets.  It would be convenient for office workers. It would cut down on traffic in the downtown area.
5119,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']",I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
5120,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']",Im from Seattle and it is mostly built over the top of the old city that burned down. I would think that they'd be able to build subways here at least through the downtown area where they have underground tours of the city.
5121,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']",My city needs a monorail that transports people from the suburbs to downtown and vice versa. the highways are not very good at providing an efficient way. A monorail would be fast and perfect
5122,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","There would be a street train that would take people from downtown down the main road to the city limits. It would also connect to service to the next big city over. Bus service would be more frequent, and Uber would be allowed to begin service."
5123,67,13,"['city', 'downtown']","What we need is a better public transportation system that services the East end of the city.  Perhaps a bullet shuttle that will pick up in certain areas of the East End, and shuttle t predetermined locations within the city such as the downtown area, in addition to other areas."
5124,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']","A concept similar to Uber, but with a bus. Especially in a city the socialization factor of riding with other passengers while going to a destination could be nice. You would be able to specifically request stops and pickups."
5125,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']",A network of publicly available electric cars will drive around the city in the most efficient manner possible. People will use apps to call a car to get them =from one of many pickup spots and drop them off before they go on the next passenger.
5126,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']","AutoTram - The network of AutoTram tracks criss-cross major streets and also cut across the city in subterranean tunnels. Instead of larger vehicles that carry many people, but have rigid, pre-defined routes, the AutoTram is reserved through the internet, and will pick up and drop off several small groups of passengers who have stops along an arithmetically chosen route."
5127,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']",Have a system of sidewalk rail cars that attaches to the sidewalks of a city. Each rail car can carry passenger anywhere in the city to any destination and stop at any time on its route. This system of transportation will greatly reduce city congestion while doesn't interfere with any of the vehicles that are already on the road.
5128,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']","Have a transportation system in the city where there is a tunneling system filled miniature train with small passenger capacity. These miniature trains can take people directly to their destination and the best part is that because they are small, there can be a large number of them running underneath the city."
5129,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']",Have motorcycle drivers go around the city picking up passengers. It would be fun for the passengers and cause less pollution.
5130,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']","have soft landing missles ""shoot"" passengers from the suburbs to the city and back"
5131,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']",I think my neighborhood and the surrounding city could use some sort of collection of energy efficient trams that can network passengers along the old railways that are no longer in use.
5132,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']","I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
5133,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']","I'm envisioning a system of small feet-sized platforms, along with a handle at arm-height, running on street-level light rail tracks throughout the city. Like an escalator, these continuously run in a loop around the city/neighborhood, and passengers can jump on and off at will. (Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger.

5134,68,11,"['city', 'passenger']","The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
5135,69,11,"['city', 'suburb']","A light rail from city center to neighboring suburbs that would replace thousands of commuters and make rush hours less crowded and stressful. This could be as simple as one station in each suburb (thus 10-15 total stations), or a more complex system with multiple stations in each suburb."
5136,69,11,"['city', 'suburb']",A rail system that goes from the outlying suburbs to the big city.

5138,69,11,"['city', 'suburb']",I live in the suburbs so all the rail lines converge on the central city. It would be nice if there was a light rail system that linked the different major suburbs together. You could connect it to the lines going to the city and across the country.

We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."

5145,69,11,"['city', 'suburb']","The suburbs are not currently served by the bus system. I believe that each suburb should get its own bus, which will take riders to a bus stop in the city. There, they may catch another bus or walk to their destination."
5146,70,11,"['city', 'tube']",A station with a tube in the ground with a high speed pod that would shoot me at a quick speed across the city or across the country in a couple hours. It would be faster than an airplane and safer too.

5150,70,11,"['city', 'tube']","Moving sidewalks all over the city would be amazing. People could hop on and even sit and get to their destination.  They'd be like the ones in airports, but they would go faster.  Some could even run into and through tubes so people would be protected in bad weather.  Something like a gerbil habitat would be amazing.  I think it would promote people walking instead of driving.  Or, just standing on the moving sidewalks.  It would reduce pollution if people took things like this around the city."
5151,70,11,"['city', 'tube']","People with money will have personal drones that are an encapsulated metal tube with glass doors and windows. The user simply programs their destination into the computer and the drone will deliver them there with non-collision software. There will be various ""drone zones"" throughout the city where people can take off and land."
5152,70,11,"['city', 'tube']","The transportation system is much into the future where you get into a cylinder and press your destination on the buttons, somewhat like an elevator. The tube launches and within minutes, you arrive at your destination within the city limits. The cylinder, if you can imagine, is one like what you put your deposits in at a bank window."
5153,70,11,"['city', 'tube']",There are a series of tubes that go over the city. The people get in and it acts like a pneumatic tube that sucks them to the next destination. It would be best for personal transport and no luggage would be allowed.
5154,70,11,"['city', 'tube']",Tubes that are linked together and are wide enough to fit a person laying down. People get in a capsule and are delivered in great speeds to their destination by using compressed air or other methods. You can have tube terminals all over the city.
5155,70,11,"['city', 'tube']",Vacuum tube travel with a central hub in various outlying cities
5156,70,11,"['city', 'tube']",We could have tubes going from the center of the city and increasingly farther out in each direction.  A person could fit in the tube and it would suck them to the other end quickly.  It would then have  a pad to stop them at the end.

In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."

Due to the apparent stigma of such, I would propose a lovely electric-run ""uber coach"" instead of the big ugly city bus.

5163,71,9,"['city', 'commuter']",My city is currently looking at High Occupancy Travel toll lanes.  I've thought that a dedicated lane for buses or van pools would be an alternative that could let the car commuters see the speed at which these other options can get to work.  This would encourage the use of the bus / van pool options.
5164,71,9,"['city', 'commuter']","My city would benefit from an elevated and enclosed train line. Regional rail is the preferred choice for many commuters but is unreliable and frustrating due to weather and traffic related delays. Though the infrastructure investment would be great, we are in need of an overhaul anyway and should improve the current system."
5165,71,9,"['city', 'commuter']","Ticket sharing system for people who make infrequent trips into the city, or suddenly need to do several trips in a row. A group of people could collectively share a commuter pass for the train or bus system. It would be like a Netflix of commuter passes.

However, despite the grid layout of the town, there is a diagonal irrigation canal running from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. Currently it has some poorly maintained walking paths, but that's about the extent of its development. Now, in the desert, loss of irrigation water to evaporation under the glaring sun is an issue. I'd propose creating a covered walkway/bike path where solar panels provide protection to the water, as well as pedestrians and cyclists. We could even use that solar energy to create small electric scooter rental/charging booths. It would provide a shortcut - a green highway from one end of town to the other."

5173,72,9,"['city', 'highway']",Segways!  Segway sidewalks that go over streets and above the normal sidewalks people walk on so you can ride your segway without stopping for traffic or having to worry about a pedestrian taking up space to get by. Segway sidewalks can even run on the edge of a major highway in bigger cities like mine to keep routes short and simple. We can even make the segways charge on solar power so they will never go dead while you're out running about.

The cars are available at convenient stations, much like bike rental stalls in cities. They are non-polluting. Anyone with a smart phone and account can book a ride at any time. Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available. The car doesn't need to be returned to its original location, just to another station. The vehicles are always well maintained and reliable, plus the service is affordable to most."

There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
5179,73,9,"['city', 'hub']","It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
5180,73,9,"['city', 'hub']","Something like a chair lift system except that it is very fast and reliable.

5191,74,9,"['city', 'ground']","Public, foot-based transportation. Something like the automatic walkways in airports, but for long stretches of large cities, particularly between common high-traffic areas.

More for suburban areas, not large city areas that have subway/rail systems."
5201,75,9,"['city', 'railway']","This is about a single user system. It is similar to a bicycle. But it's does not run on road. It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable. We take it from home or rent from government."
5202,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']",A high speed monorail system that winds its way through all the important points of interest in the city. It would look futuristic and high tech with a sophisticated level of design along with being reliable.
5203,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']","A monorail system that is above everyone.  There would be rail cars on it that go in a multitude of directions.  People can still use the other forms of transportation, but this form would be strictly for people looking to get around in the city.  They would park their cars before entering the city, and use this quick system for getting around.  No more crowded, expensive parking in the city."
5204,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']","A mutli-layed monorail system that is solar and wind powered. I leave in las vegas, which has a centralized population. It would go up and down the strip and between the strip and downtown and around the city."
5205,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']",A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
5206,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']","An alternative transport that would be excellent would be a monorail in my city.  It could be run with electricity, with many train cars, and go along the main north south route.  You could get almost anywhere in quickly and easily if it went along that route."
5207,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']","I want a monorail system to run above street level (may be 20 feet up or so).  I want it to connect the suburbs to downtown, and circle the city.  It would run on magnets so that it would be extremely quiet.  It would be extremely fast.  I want it to provide a bird's eye view for commuters.  It would be a very safe way to travel, crime and personal safety would not be an issue."
5208,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']","I wish we had a monorail between the airport and our city. We aren't connected to any public transportation system, but more than 70% of our residents travel by plane more than once a year. Many people travel for work, etc. Rather than each of us driving and paying to park our cars there, if we could stay in our suburb and take the monorail (or train) to and from it would save a great deal of money and time."
5209,76,9,"['city', 'monorail']","Monorail through the city! Just like Disneyland, this city-wide system allows you to see the city from a bird's eye! Simply get on at one of the many stations around town and enjoy your ride without stops, traffic or bad weather. The rails above the city means growth can continue without getting in the way of transport, and means you can watch the world below!"

5211,77,9,"['city', 'line']","A sort of rail line, but it's a single rail and has many hanging carts. The carts hold maybe 4 people at a time, like a taxi. The price would be cheaper than a bus and they would arrive quickly when you need them. You could push a button on poles that are located around the city, far more often than bus stops, and the cart will come to you quickly and take you directly to your destination. No need for bus drivers or waiting for traffic!"
5212,77,9,"['city', 'line']","A walking pathway across every rooftop in the city.   It would cut down on danger from cars, and it'd be fun to see the scenery.  This could easily be constructed with some good, sturdy planks.  Line them up on the roof, screw them in or hammer them in.  Every building would have a fire escape on it for easy access back to the street.  This would save much time as you could go ""as the eagle flies."" straight across the roofs."

5215,77,9,"['city', 'line']",I live in a rural community about 1 hour from a city. I would like to see this area build a light rail commuter line that could link these isolated communities and boost the economy. Many people out here do not even have cars.
5216,77,9,"['city', 'line']",I live in the suburbs so all the rail lines converge on the central city. It would be nice if there was a light rail system that linked the different major suburbs together. You could connect it to the lines going to the city and across the country.
5217,77,9,"['city', 'line']",I picture a streamlined 'box' like a cable car that is hanging from a line or track throughout the city. It would be shaped like a rectangle with smooth edges and very compact and sleak. It glides up to the booth where people may get on and each cable car 'box' can hold 6 people in 3 rows of 2 with a small walking aisle to the side.
5218,77,9,"['city', 'line']","My city would benefit from an elevated and enclosed train line. Regional rail is the preferred choice for many commuters but is unreliable and frustrating due to weather and traffic related delays.

5221,78,8,"['city', 'pedestrian']",Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.
5222,78,8,"['city', 'pedestrian']","I imagine a series of widening arches or loops of roadway and of several different sizes to accompany different types of pubic transport. Cars wouldn't be allowed in the city but stored at various exit point garages which would be provided by the city. Small roads would have small shuttles, large roads would have large fast moving shuttles that span the city. Independently, smaller walkways would be used for pedestrians and cyclists (and other man powered or tiny engine machines.) Larger walkways could become festival street fair type roads that are common in places like Greece."
5223,78,8,"['city', 'pedestrian']","I live in a small desert city with a major traffic congestion issue. However, despite the grid layout of the town, there is a diagonal irrigation canal running from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. Currently it has some poorly maintained walking paths, but that's about the extent of its development. Now, in the desert, loss of irrigation water to evaporation under the glaring sun is an issue. I'd propose creating a covered walkway/bike path where solar panels provide protection to the water, as well as pedestrians and cyclists. We could even use that solar energy to create small electric scooter rental/charging booths. It would provide a shortcut - a green highway from one end of town to the other."
5224,78,8,"['city', 'pedestrian']","I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
5225,78,8,"['city', 'pedestrian']","I would love it if the city made walking and riding a bike more user friendly. There are no areas that are safe for pedestrians or bikers. If there were a bike lane, more people could move independently and get to where they are going. Commuters using more than one mode of transportation would be able to get to their destinations more quickly and with greater safety."
5226,78,8,"['city', 'pedestrian']",Segways!  Segway sidewalks that go over streets and above the normal sidewalks people walk on so you can ride your segway without stopping for traffic or having to worry about a pedestrian taking up space to get by. Segway sidewalks can even run on the edge of a major highway in bigger cities like mine to keep routes short and simple. We can even make the segways charge on solar power so they will never go dead while you're out running about.
5227,78,8,"['city', 'pedestrian']","There is no public transportation in my neighborhood. We do not even have sidewalks for pedestrians. It is a major problem that I wish could be fixed, but no one cares about rural cities."
5228,79,7,"['city', 'walkway']","Have the streets be less wide, in order to have small row gardens on the sides on the sidewalks. This interactive, edible walkway would promote and provide sidewalk snacks and usability. Easy fresh pick veggetables and fruits, less flooding and more city beauty!"

It seems like it would be really nice for people, since people walk a lot here. Also, if there was a way to sit while moving, people could get work done and other things, while taking a 'slow ride' down the street (slower than a train, etc, so people can get on/ off while it's moving)."
5232,79,7,"['city', 'walkway']",My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.

5237,80,7,"['city', 'trolley']",I think a trolley system would work really well here. I live in Fort Collins and the city is very centralized but the traffic is terrible - perfect for a trolley!
5238,80,7,"['city', 'trolley']","I would like a city trolley. The trolley would travel around the city several times a day, taking and picking up residents from the major shopping areas. The trolley stops should be no more than two blocks from any neighborhood."
5239,80,7,"['city', 'trolley']",Something akin to a streetcar or trolley bus system could be very useful in my city.  It would have its own designated lane and be a useful public transportation alternative.
5240,80,7,"['city', 'trolley']","The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
5241,80,7,"['city', 'trolley']",We ought to revisit the trolley system because the buses in New York City are plagued by heavy traffic. We should have electric trolleys on main thoroughfares. It worked in the old days. Sometimes old ideas mixed with new technology is GENIUS!
5242,81,7,"['city', 'airport']","An app based method of ride sharing public transit. City drivers in fuel efficient vans would respond to requested pick ups. The pick up requested by a rider would be assigned a pick up time within a short variable of the requested pick up (say 30 minutes), the van will pick up multiple parties near each other and drop them off at their destinations similar to the shared airport shuttles."
5243,81,7,"['city', 'airport']","Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
5244,81,7,"['city', 'airport']",I always thought they should incorporate moving sidewalks into the city. Just like the airport. This would allow people to scoot around faster without putting more people on the road.

They'd be like the ones in airports, but they would go faster.  Some could even run into and through tubes so people would be protected in bad weather.  Something like a gerbil habitat would be amazing.  I think it would promote people walking instead of driving.  Or, just standing on the moving sidewalks.  It would reduce pollution if people took things like this around the city."

There are dozens of air ferries lifting people quietly into the air and to major cities all across America. The carbon footprint of the consumer aviation industry is drastically reduced. The noise pollution of traditional airports is all but gone. The hybrid airship is the vehicle of choice in terms of transportation.
5249,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']",A public taxi system dedicated to public transportation.  Standard operating hours and funded through taxes.  On demand pick up via city based app.  Essentially eliminating everyday drivers.
5250,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']","An alternative transportation system in my neighborhood could involve something such as a taxi like service but one that ran kind of like a bus, involving general cars. These services could flow around the city and offer rides to people who may not be able to afford any other type of transportation."

5252,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']","Handicapped taxi. Public transportation is awful in my area, so if you are in a wheelchair then you need an expensive handicapped van just to be able to get around. Some taxi wheelchair van options would be great for people who can't afford a $30,000 wheelchair van and might otherwise have a hard time getting around."
5253,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']","I have recently returned a small-to-mid-sized city (60,000+ people, down from over 125,000 at its peak) after 20 years, and the public transportation system here is non-existent, Uber does not exist here (the nearest key city of 250,000+ people is 40 miles away), and there are 2 very small taxi companies which are not cost-effective or nearby enough to be efficient to use. In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."
5254,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']","I live in NYC. Travel is not too difficult, with the only real concern being the price of a subway ticket or a taxi ride. With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue. I believe that since the roads and the undergrounds are already full, the only real option is to expand transportation above ground, such as on rails between buildings. This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem."
5255,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']",I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
5256,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']","I think driverless taxi services are going to be the dominant transportation systems in the future. Sort of like having a whole bunch of Uber drivers out there picking up whoever needs it. I don't think that vehicle ownership will be nearly as widespread as it is these days, as driverless cars will be far safer."
5257,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']","I think that a new mod of transportation in my neighborhood would be a electric bike taxi system. It would be an electric bike pulling a carriage that hold up to 3 other people. The system will travel from people's houses to their work place, local shopping centers and local entertainment places."
5258,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']",I would like to imagine being able to create a app and that uses credit cards. and invent a motorcycle scooter that has a huge row of seats in the back and runs like a mini van and use it as a taxi service. for only the city that I live in and name it Go Scooter transportation.
5259,82,15,"['transportation', 'taxi']","I would like to see an advanced transportation system that involved driverless cars.  The idea is the same as using a taxi but without a driver.  Like Uber, you would use your mobile device to order a car and control the experience.  The car shows up at your door, takes you to your destination and you are billed for the ride. It would save me thousands of dollars in the cost to own, maintain, insure and license my own personal car."

In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."

5354,91,8,"['transportation', 'parking']","Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."
5355,92,7,"['transportation', 'pedestrian']",A new transportation system would include a mono rail system that is built above the streets and sidewalks where pedestrians can move quickly from one side of the city to the next with having to negotiate with traffic. Once you get to your train station destination there will be a system of buses who would be at the train station waiting to take you to a variety of different bus stations. The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.
5356,92,7,"['transportation', 'pedestrian']",A transportation Idea I have is to have networked building walkways. Think of it like your average street crossing but instead of connecting streets it connects neighboring buildings instead. There would be no access to private buildings but pedestrians would be able to walk enclosed walkways running through special areas in the building to get to the next. I think this idea is very practical in heavy urban areas and would be a refreshing change from the average commute.

In a situation like this, any alternative transportation would be beneficial, as this is a city where without a car/traditional vehicle, your ability to get even basic errands accomplished is compromised greatly. The city cited low ridership and rising fuel costs to keep the giant, hulking city buses operating as the reason for cancelling the public routes. My proposal would be to have smaller, and highly fuel-efficient modified Sprinter vans, each serving one small portion of the community, and running a smaller amount of the fleet during off-peak hours. This would allow the most economical and efficient model for the community to have access to needed transportation."

Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available.

Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."

The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports.

But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area.

In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi.

It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."

You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new.

In otherwords, free to the people who use the bus, and costs the people who don't. have the busses rinning from a set time like 6am to 9 pm  and pickups are every 15 min, so you never need to bother with knowing the bus schedule. Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."
5578,120,5,"['bus', 'shopping']","A roaming private car that you can pay by the mile or carpool.

5587,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']",A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
5588,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']",A new trolley system with free transportation would be beneficial since the neighborhood isn't very big and it would do well for people who could be handicap. I think the new trolley system could be hybrid -- electric and gas -- which most trolleys aren't.
5589,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']","A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
5590,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']",A trolley would be awesome in my small neighborhood since it already has a decent grid of streets
5591,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']","Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross.

Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
5592,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']",I believe my neighborhood should have some sort of electronic trolley system.  I can take multiple people throughout the day and network workers to certain destinations and landmarks.

5594,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']","I would like a city trolley. The trolley would travel around the city several times a day, taking and picking up residents from the major shopping areas. The trolley stops should be no more than two blocks from any neighborhood."

So when getting kids to school in our town, we could have some sort of trolley or train-like vehicle that could go up and down the alleys picking up the kids. This would be quick and efficient and the kids would want to go to school because it would be fun and exciting."
5597,122,11,"['neighborhood', 'trolley']","The new transportation is a light rail that also includes trolley service for my neighborhood and city. For $1.00 each way, the light rail runs from east to west and from north to south. In addition, the light rail runs until midnight Monday through Friday and 24 hours a day on weekends. The light rail takes you to all major events in the city and portion of all fares go to pay for school resources in the community."
5598,123,9,"['neighborhood', 'tram']","A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."

5600,123,9,"['neighborhood', 'tram']","I live in a very hilly neighborhood. I suggest a funicular! A funicular is a railway built on a steep hill with tram cars for transport. Put it on one of the hills in the center of the neighborhood. People would be only a short walk (less than 10 minutes), hop on the funicular and it could take them to the church, the school and the neighborhood business district. Bam. No more worrying about going up and down the crazy hills, especially in the winter. Booyah!"
5601,123,9,"['neighborhood', 'tram']",I think my neighborhood and the surrounding city could use some sort of collection of energy efficient trams that can network passengers along the old railways that are no longer in use.
5602,123,9,"['neighborhood', 'tram']",In my neighborhood I think the best type of transportation system would be an elevated railway like a tram at disney world it would make commuting between neighboring cities far easier and the technology would make commutes more timely.
5603,123,9,"['neighborhood', 'tram']",It would be an electric tram that would ride in the center turning lane of my neighborhood.  It would look like a two-car train that would seat around 40 people.  It would make frequent stops at major intersections and shopping centers in the neighborhood by pulling off to the side in the bike lane. It would have solar panels on the top to help off-set the electricity use.
5604,123,9,"['neighborhood', 'tram']",It would be like a super fast tram or train so the people in my neighborhood could get to run errands without their cars. We could have stops at the entrances to the neighborhood and the tracks could just run down the street.

5608,124,9,"['neighborhood', 'downtown']","I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city.

5610,124,9,"['neighborhood', 'downtown']",I think my neighborhood would benefit from one of those pedal bike bars for the downtown area. There is a lot of history and what better way to enjoy it than while sipping a nice drink and getting some exercise
5611,124,9,"['neighborhood', 'downtown']",I wish my neighborhood had a giant conveyor belt for going to all the main places downtown.  It would help the older people as well be convenient.  It would have to be waterproof and covered.  It could run all along the one side of the main intersections without ever having to cross.
5612,124,9,"['neighborhood', 'downtown']",I would like to see an expanded light rail system with more of a neighborhood connection.  Right now our light rail pretty much just connects the Downtown core with the airport.
5613,124,9,"['neighborhood', 'downtown']",I would like to see my city connected via a light rail system which would greatly reduce traffic and emissions.  I envision the majority of neighborhoods in the Downtown core being connected.
5614,124,9,"['neighborhood', 'downtown']","My neighborhood added an above ground train similar to the ""L"" in Chicago.  It runs along the highways bringing people downtown from the suburbs.  It does a few loops downtown and runs near the major companies to get people to work.  It is much cheaper and more convenient than driving downtown and parking."
5615,124,9,"['neighborhood', 'downtown']","My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
5616,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']","-a gondola system like at a ski resort

5617,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']",A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
5618,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']","An idea I've had is the concept of personal golf carts that are used in malls, country clubs and campuses but having a few of these carts that use alternative energy methods like charging or solar power. 



They would be small and won't go at very high speeds but they could be useful for getting people in the neighborhood around for errands or nearby places while saving them money on gas and helping the environment somewhat.



It could be a small fleet the neighborhood keeps around and they are rented out to the local community for a small fee or monthly payment."
5619,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']",I can imagine my neighborhood having a high speed maglev train. It will levitate on top of a rail that will span around the entire city to avoid traffic. It will be fast and efficient to provide good transportation services.
5620,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']",I would love if my neighborhood had a rail system that worked from magnets and floated along the rail at high speeds.  I wish that the cars were individual and that I could get in and select from a list of destinations.  I would like my own car and to be able to bring my dogs with me.  It would be fast and smooth and work with minimal power.
5621,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']","my neighborhood future transportation system will be made up of flying cars. This cars will be able to take off and land like helicopters. There will be no more traffic jams, traffic light, annoying speed limits and harassing cops.

There will be new telecommunication and navigation technology that will help the drivers navigate safely without having mid air collisions and also mid air gas stations to refuel the cars."
5622,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']",My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.
5623,125,8,"['neighborhood', 'speed']","There are many back roads and residential routes around my neighborhood, so speed isn't as much of an issue to keep pace with traffic. I'd imagine a fleet of scooters that could be rented cheaply and easily could help residents get around town without much issue."

5625,126,8,"['neighborhood', 'airport']","I think a great idea within my neighborhood would basically to have a moving sidewalk like you would find at an airport.  This would allow people to move about faster than maybe they would walking, so people wouldn't feel the need to get in the car to go down the block to the store."
5626,126,8,"['neighborhood', 'airport']",I think a new transportation that utilizes a type of rail system on the sidewalks that people can easily easily walk throughout the neighborhood - similar to the moving walkways at airports.  Sort of like a conveyor belt for people.

A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."
5647,129,5,"['neighborhood', 'passenger']",I think my neighborhood and the surrounding city could use some sort of collection of energy efficient trams that can network passengers along the old railways that are no longer in use.
5648,129,5,"['neighborhood', 'passenger']","My idea alternative transportation in the neighborhood would be horseback. There would be nice safe wide equestrian trails throughout allowing you to visit neighbors, go to the convenience or grocery store which would have hitching posts. Motorized vehicles would be limited to passenger cars/trucks."
5649,129,5,"['neighborhood', 'passenger']","This new transportation system is a bullet train in the sky, able to span around the neighborhood with up to 700 passengers in under two minutes. It's sleek silver coat is never late, and always early to make sure everyone gets where they need to go. The rails float there in the sky, ready to carry this majestic beauty to the ends of the neighborhood making sure everyone is early"
5650,130,5,"['neighborhood', 'railway']",A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
5651,130,5,"['neighborhood', 'railway']",A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be a railway system available to rural and outlying areas.  It would stretch along the roadway and connect to different cities and stops much like a trolley system or train system.  People could get on and off at different points.  They could schedule to be picked up at different times during the day.
5652,130,5,"['neighborhood', 'railway']","I live in a very hilly neighborhood. I suggest a funicular! A funicular is a railway built on a steep hill with tram cars for transport. Put it on one of the hills in the center of the neighborhood. People would be only a short walk (less than 10 minutes), hop on the funicular and it could take them to the church, the school and the neighborhood business district. Bam. No more worrying about going up and down the crazy hills, especially in the winter. Booyah!"
5653,130,5,"['neighborhood', 'railway']",I think my neighborhood and the surrounding city could use some sort of collection of energy efficient trams that can network passengers along the old railways that are no longer in use.
5654,130,5,"['neighborhood', 'railway']",In my neighborhood I think the best type of transportation system would be an elevated railway like a tram at disney world it would make commuting between neighboring cities far easier and the technology would make commutes more timely.
5655,131,5,"['neighborhood', 'monorail']","An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
5656,131,5,"['neighborhood', 'monorail']",I would imagine a monorail type of situation.  With frequent stops around the neighborhood so everyone was able to get on relatively near their home.  It would move quickly and make stops at the nearby schools and stores.
5657,131,5,"['neighborhood', 'monorail']",In my neighborhood it would be like a monorail system. Something that you could get on at one stop and take it to another are you would want to go. Connecting locations you would visit.
5658,131,5,"['neighborhood', 'monorail']",It would be cool it we had a monorail type system throughout the neighborhood that does a simple circle and takes kids or adults from the neighboorhood into the town/school area.
5659,131,5,"['neighborhood', 'monorail']","Kind of a monorail system that goes from stops in neighborhoods and takes people to a stop near the stores, etc.  Open top with a cover, no need to heat or cool, wouldn't run in extreme weather."
5660,132,5,"['neighborhood', 'line']","A new transportation system in my neighborhood would be similar to a train line, just on a smaller scale. It would pick people up in a series of pods and deposit them at their place of work for a small fee. This new train type line could also be used in the same way that a bus is, to run errands. The new system would have comfortable couch like chairs and be far more acceptable than the current forms of trnasportation availabe."
5661,132,5,"['neighborhood', 'line']",Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
5662,132,5,"['neighborhood', 'line']","Instead of paving trucks coming through the neighborhoods, laying down new asphalt, it would be soap trucks.  The streets would be lined with giant tarps, and people would slip and slide to their destinations on specially crafted slip and sliders.  They would look sort of like a canoe, but with a flat bottom.  I think underneath the tarp, there would be air pockets that sensed whenever an object passed over them.  Whenever an object passes over the air pockets, they rapidly self inflate, thereby pushing the slip and slide canoe further and faster."
5663,132,5,"['neighborhood', 'line']",The future transportation system in my neighborhood would possibly incorporate traffic light systems that would detect the amount of traffic and flow to better keep traffic moving and prevent long lines and wait times at intersections therefor reducing trip times and automobile emissions.
5664,132,5,"['neighborhood', 'line']",what is needed is a tubular powered zipline based transportation system. a combination of pnewumatic and electric power will propel people from place to place in a similar manner to a ski lift except it would just be a small tube that has a chain of sorts running in it along the sidewalks. all you would have to do is to have a harness on and when you need to go to one of the destinations you hook on to the line that is color coded for your destination and cruise on down there. Not the most comfortable way to travel but the infrastructure for a neighborhood would be relatively inexpensive.
5665,133,5,"['neighborhood', 'subway']",A rail that goes back and forth from campus with known arrival times would be ideal for students to travel from campus to their homes and neighborhoods. This would be like a miniature above ground subway.
5666,133,5,"['neighborhood', 'subway']","An underground network system in the neighborhood, like a subway but only bikes and small motorcycles can travel through. This will be a good way to protect against the weather and steer clear of any incoming cars."
5667,133,5,"['neighborhood', 'subway']","Atlanta could have a much, much wider public transportation system. The subway would go to many different neighborhoods, extending in different directions instead of being a simple cross. More money and attention would be given to public transportation, extending bus and trolley service while halting the neverending expansion of parking and roads. Much more attention will be given to cyclist and pedestrian safety, with enforced ticketing for drivers that ignore traffic laws along with more bike lanes and pedestrian crossings."
5668,133,5,"['neighborhood', 'subway']",Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.

5669,133,5,"['neighborhood', 'subway']",underground subway that extends to all major neighborhoods. It would be fast and convenient to use.
5670,134,4,"['neighborhood', 'hub']","A solar-powered trolley system that works like an automated bus, mixed with a roller coaster.  No need for a driver, as each trolley heads to a central location and goes from different sections of neighborhoods.  They would run quickly perhaps so that  a trolley will collect people and head to its destination every 15 minutes.  It makes short transportation to hub areas cleaner, safer, and nicer, and can be closed during non-business hours of the hub area."
5671,134,4,"['neighborhood', 'hub']","It would be an underground bullet train system that connected major hubs around the city. It would take only minutes to get from one station to the other across town. There would be train systems at each neighborhood of the city, and you could get on an off at any stop in the underground tunnel.You would pay with a chip card so that you wouldn't need to carry cash or change. The bullet trains would be large capacity so that overcrowding of buses would be a thing of the past."
5672,134,4,"['neighborhood', 'hub']","It would be small individual electric golf cart-like cars that run along the edge of the sidewalks every couple of minutes that people can hop into to go to the grocery store, pharmacy, post office, etc.  they operate from out of a common neighborhood ""hub"" so each system covers a small area.  People can just call one from an app on their smart phone, they are charged a small fee, then after the trip, the cart remains in one area until it is called again or it returns to the hub to be charged."
5673,134,4,"['neighborhood', 'hub']",This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
5674,135,4,"['neighborhood', 'district']","I live in a rural area, it's pretty hilly but it runs along the length of a valley. It would be really nice to have a walking/bike path that connects the residential neighborhood to the commercial district without having the bike/walk on the road. Although it's generally slow traffic, walking on the road is never exactly safe. Especially in the winter. To be able to network together the few towns in the valley too would be very nice."

5677,135,4,"['neighborhood', 'district']","I was thinking that since the city I live in has a decently sized river, to save money, be cost effective, and lower power/energy usage, we can ferry people and personnel to central districts of the city and my neighborhood. Maybe the ferries/boat could be turbine powered to be more energy efficient."
5678,136,4,"['neighborhood', 'route']","A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station."
5679,136,4,"['neighborhood', 'route']",I imagine a way to ride a school bus to various spots on its route. You would be pre-screened as an adult who could act as a school bus monitor and at the same time gain transportation to a location near the school. It would solve the problem of kids riding unsupervised and give another public transportation option in the neighborhood.
5680,136,4,"['neighborhood', 'route']",I'd like to see the railroad tracks by our house be repurposed as a walking and biking route for the neighborhood.  It would be really sweet if they could use that and carry the corridor all the way to the nearest town and shopping area.
5681,136,4,"['neighborhood', 'route']","There are many back roads and residential routes around my neighborhood, so speed isn't as much of an issue to keep pace with traffic. I'd imagine a fleet of scooters that could be rented cheaply and easily could help residents get around town without much issue."
5682,137,4,"['neighborhood', 'its']",A new way to transport in my neighborhood? I would honestly say cabs. They are not around where I live. But a cheaper way and only in the city. It's mostly just busses and the stops are few and far between.
5683,137,4,"['neighborhood', 'its']",A pedi cab service similar to Uber. People would sign up to drive people around on their bicycles. It's a small neighborhood and could easily be done. The call service could have a phone app and website to make it easier to schedule pick ups.
5684,137,4,"['neighborhood', 'its']",It's a small town. In and near the town center there will be bike lanes and you will be able to access all neighborhoods in an easy and safe manner. There will be bike rental kiosks throughout the area. For areas outside town there could be a service with electric vehicles that you can book ahead of time and you can catch a ride to select locations around town.

5686,138,3,"['neighborhood', 'commuter']","I think that some sort of charging commuter car should be parked in every neighborhood. People could coordinate commute times and use electric cars instead of gas, in exchange they pay $1 a day to drive the car per person."
5687,138,3,"['neighborhood', 'commuter']","In my neighborhood, any kind of public transportation would be innovative. Due to the apparent stigma of such, I would propose a lovely electric-run ""uber coach"" instead of the big ugly city bus. This could be as simple as a mini-van and could deliver us suffering commuters of Southern California from a few select and regular pick-up spots to bigger, car-pool mega spots at various freeway points."
5688,138,3,"['neighborhood', 'commuter']","There are solar powered buses in my neighborhood which are 100% sustainable and operate autonomously, very much like the commuter trams at some airports such as Miami International Airport. These require no labor, and as such, have no human element involved in decisionmaking. As they are programmed to stop at intervals (designated by where the bus stops would be) there is a set time to off-load and pick up customers. OF course, handicapped and large groups can press a certain button which would allow more time and/or ramps to deploy."

5694,140,3,"['neighborhood', 'safety']","Not just in my neighborhood but metro-wide, my city recently established time share bicycles people can rent and ride when they have a short distance to travel. The bikes are all of the same design, having a large sturdy frame painted light blue, three gears (the gear box is inside the rear wheel axle, and LED blinker lights for safety. Necessarily, it's a one-size-fits-all arrangement; there's no way to raise or lower the seat unless you carry your own tools around with you, so if you're a tall person and use one of these bikes you'll be knocking yourself in the chin with your knees."
5695,141,3,"['neighborhood', 'overhead']","A system where there are rails above you and nothing underneath you.

You sit in a cart of sorts and you are guided along near the streets, maybe above the streets or sidewalk.

The railings connect overhead and end at each sidewalk and gives you a nice view of the neighborhood, kind of like a ski-lift."
5696,141,3,"['neighborhood', 'overhead']","My neighborhood is very organized, but has very few buses.  I'd love to see a ski 'pod' style transportation.  There would be several station, and you would enter a pod, and ride.  There would be a whole network of pod so you could go all over town.  It will also be overhead, like over the sidewalks and bike paths."
5697,141,3,"['neighborhood', 'overhead']","Ultimate monkey bars.  People are too fat in my area, forcing them to travel via monkey bars across the neighborhood should help not only with emission decrease, but weight decrease as well!  There will just be an overhead system running the lengths of the sidewalks at 7 foot high so no one gets hurt if they fall."
5698,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']",A bunch of self driving cars that will replace buses and taxis. The will have free wifi and be very cheap.
5699,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']","A fleet of cheap, reliable, automated taxi cars. The cars would drive automatically after an input was made for the destination. These cars would be self charging with paint that has solar energy potential."
5700,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']",A taxi service where self-driving cars can be dispatched to a client which then drive the client to their destination and then return to HQ.
5701,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']","As a socially awkward recluse who doesn't drive, I want to be able to call an automated system for a driver-less taxi. I want the option to pay online via debit/credit, gift card or Paypal or have the option to insert bills into the car door before being able to enter. I'd like to be able to pick my music genres for the ride as well."
5702,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']","Automated taxi service. Would have several dispatch stations in key areas of city. Person could call for a ride from an app on their phone and it would send a car to them. The software could calculate rate for the trip and make you pay before as a confirmation before sending a car out. Car could then drive customer to said destination.  Self driveable cars that could provide a much better service than the often RUDE cab drivers could provide. Plus, I trust a robot way more than some of these morons driving!"
5703,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']","I live in a snowy climate, so there are a lot of times that we can't drive our cars anywhere because of all the snow. So a snowmobile taxi might work."
5704,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']",I live in a town right on the ocean and there are many canals here. I think a canoe taxi service would be really convenient and fun. It wouldn't get people to their desired locations super fast but it would allow people to travel leisurely and enjoy the scenery along the way. It would also be really healthy for the people driving the canoes and help them to stay fit.
5705,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']","I live in a very rural area that doesn't get bus service because of low population. My idea would be a bus service that runs on the same premise as a taxi service... when someone in the area would need a ride, the bus would alter its route to pick up a passenger. That way, the remote area could be serviced by mass transit, yet wouldn't have to waste fuel or money driving to the remote area all of the time. These requests could be put in via phone, web portal, or e-mail."
5706,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']",I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
5707,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']","I would love to see some kind of computer-operated taxi service in my city. The roads would be a lot safer of cars weren't being driven by humans, and I feel like people would be a lot more productive. I would love if I could just sit in the backseat and read or do work on my way to work, instead of having to pay attention to the road every second. It would also save money from having to buy a car if I could jsut call one of these taxis whenever I need to go somewhere."
5708,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']","Self driving cars that could detect traffic/other cars and could navigate to a specific location would be great in this town, especially at night to avoid accidents due to intoxicated driving of college students. The cars could be rented from the town and ordered similarly to taxi cabs, and could drive students home from the bars for a fee without relying on very tired or intoxicated friends to do so."
5709,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']",think it will be self driving cars aka taxis coming soon. really when apple says they are working on a self driving car
5710,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']",Transportation that would allow people to rent out electric self driving cars. This would let people have cars pick them up at whatever location they want and have the car autonomously drive to their destination. Similar to a fleet of self driving electric taxis. This would greatly reduce the cost of transportation in my opinion because people would not have to buy cars but could rather rent or lease them.
5711,142,14,"['drive', 'taxi']",Combining food delivery services with taxi driving to maximize efficiency.
5712,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']",A network of publicly available electric cars will drive around the city in the most efficient manner possible. People will use apps to call a car to get them =from one of many pickup spots and drop them off before they go on the next passenger.
5713,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']","A pod/train system that runs on the shoulder of roads. It would be more active than typical buses, and be more personal in that there can be no more than 4 passengers. It would run on a track or in the future it would would run with automatic sensing software and would drive itself."
5714,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']","An app that worked somewhat like Uber, but is for ride-sharing/car pooling.  You put in your destination, whether you can drive or not, what time you need to be to your destination, and an acceptable range for the location.  The app would look for others with similar destinations or destinations en-route for others as well as the best route to minimize drive time, but maximize people getting to their destination.  Then the app would calculate a fair percentage of the ride cost for each person based on their destination, travel distance, etc.  Public transportation here isn't great because we are so spread out.  After each ride you could rate other passengers and the driver and those ratings could be used to filter out bad users entirely or just below a certain rating level."
5715,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']","An automated system of cabs. Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."

The postal service itself will begin to implement this delivery method on some routes. There will be specific roadways built to accommodate these new vehicles and special lanes, much like a carpool lane, that are available to only automated transports. Traffic, pollution and accidents will decrease sharply and it will be difficult to even obtain a license for a private vehicle although not impossible. This will largely be in place at the turn of the next century but some will be in service sooner."
5718,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']","I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
5719,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']","In the future, self driving cabs can be summoned via mobile phone, to pick up the driver and take them to a particular destination via a touchscreen or other similar interface located inside the vehicle.  Some difficulty may occur if the passenger is unsure of the address of his or her destination, but a trained attendant can be called to determine the location for the passenger."
5720,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']","My idea is a combination of self driving cars, rideshare and a train. Commuters would pay for a ticket and a line of connected self driving cars would take commuters going the same route/direction to a certain dropoff point, like a train does. Then when the string of cars reaches the stop point, each passenger can enter their desired destination into the touchpad screen in the car and they would be driven to their individual destinations. The self driving cars would break off individually from the train to take these passengers, then they'd return on their own to the ""train station"" to go pick up more passengers."
5721,143,10,"['drive', 'passenger']","The future of transport in my city is likely a self driving car service system. There will be kiosks with cars waiting and you simply go into the car, put your destination into a computer and pay. It is as simple as that. The self driving cars will know how to avoid traffic and accidents and will automatically take the shortest and most sensible route to any destination. The self driving car will allow for multiple passengers and the cars will vary in size."
5722,144,10,"['drive', 'route']","A social platform similar to facebook related to all things travel. People would be able to connect with others and find people traveling the same route.

5799,158,4,"['drive', 'subway']","My idea is of a drive-on subway. Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

In the back of the scooter object would be a large area where personal baggage and things can be kept and it automatically locks once enough passengers are aboard. This area is kept locked by the operator of the scooter ride. On each side of the edges of the scooter ride are places for phones and other devices to be plugged in.

Also, have all busses make a stop in the center of town so if you need to get across town, take a bus from you house to the center, and from there to your final destination. There should be a bus passing every school, hospital, shopping center, library ect. Simply run smaller buses on less popular routes, use smaller buses in general. make one special route for city to city transfers. The system needs to be free or very affordable, fast and convenient. No need to waste resources and infrastructure on schedules, call centers, web pages, just keep it simple and convenient."

Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible.

It could also allow people to get where they need to go faster, if they continue to walk along the moving sidewalk.  They could sit alongside regular sidewalks, so people who still wanted to go out for a walk and get some fresh air could do so.

Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way.

There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time.

It could also allow people to get where they need to go faster, if they continue to walk along the moving sidewalk.  They could sit alongside regular sidewalks, so people who still wanted to go out for a walk and get some fresh air could do so.

Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new.

Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."

6145,213,4,"['bike', 'tunnel']","An underground tunnel system just for people, bikes and mopeds.  The idea is that all the cars and congestion can stay up above and people can safely walk or transport themselves around without worrying about cars and busses getting in the way or being run over by them.  Every so often there is a ramp that allows you to exit, as well as natural light through grates and proper ventilation.  It would also be a great way to get around when it snows."
6146,213,4,"['bike', 'tunnel']","I want a large, underground series of tunnels that offer a combination of walking paths, bike paths, and people movers so that people can easily move around the city during winter.

6150,214,3,"['bike', 'water']",Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.

This increases automobile and public transit use. By building footpaths or bike paths that bypass the highways, I think that the local government could reduce traffic, and thereby reduce gas consumption and environmental pollution."
6155,216,3,"['bike', 'shopping']","I think that a new mod of transportation in my neighborhood would be a electric bike taxi system.

6156,216,3,"['bike', 'shopping']",I think there should be bikes that you can easily rent. You can get them in the major shopping areas and drive them around town to get excercise as well as helping to use less gasoline.
6157,216,3,"['bike', 'shopping']",It would be an electric tram that would ride in the center turning lane of my neighborhood.  It would look like a two-car train that would seat around 40 people.  It would make frequent stops at major intersections and shopping centers in the neighborhood by pulling off to the side in the bike lane. It would have solar panels on the top to help off-set the electricity use.
6158,217,3,"['bike', 'mall']",Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
6159,217,3,"['bike', 'mall']","I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness."
6160,217,3,"['bike', 'mall']","Publicly available bicycles could be stationed at different regions of the town: different parts of the University campus, the downtown square, the region of stores and malls for shopping.

6171,221,3,"['bike', 'device']","Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."
6172,221,3,"['bike', 'device']",Stalls that allow people to rent and drop off bicycles so they can get around the city without wasting gas and causing pollution. Implant GPS devices inside the bikes so they can't be stolen.
6173,222,19,"['train', 'speed']",A new system of transporation in my neighborhood that I would really enjoy is high speed trains that could get you from one part of the city to  another in 5 minutes. The transportation would have ample amount seating for the fast trip and great views of the city. I would want for this train to run above the streets and not over the streets so some kind of over ground railway would have to be created.
6174,222,19,"['train', 'speed']",A rail system that is build from the ground up. This would be capable of high speeds typically not able to travel when driving or on another train. This would make work transit much faster.

With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue. I believe that since the roads and the undergrounds are already full, the only real option is to expand transportation above ground, such as on rails between buildings. This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem."
6184,222,19,"['train', 'speed']","I picture a brand new train system, going down the main street, with street cars going leading up to the main street.   I would love to see it being a high speed system, paying with your fingerprints.   It would be similar to a credit card."
6185,222,19,"['train', 'speed']",I see a totally different way of transportation in the future. I see solar a powered tram replacing all the buses and since the cost is so much lower there will be many more of them so you can get anywhere you want to go anytime. In addition to the in city tram there will be a super high speed solar powered train that can go 150 mph or more! That will make it so what used to be a 2 hour drive or more will now be a short train ride away. For those who do not want to take the tram there will be an unmanned flying drone taxi. All you do it either tell it your destination or input the location yourself and it automatically takes you there.
6186,222,19,"['train', 'speed']","I think for small towns like mine (20,000) we should have a cross between a trolley and a hoverboard. If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
6187,222,19,"['train', 'speed']",I would like to see a high speed train connect all the major cities in my state as well as the major cities bordering our state.  I envision this high speed train to have minimal stations.  This would eliminate the need for air travel and long road trips.
6188,222,19,"['train', 'speed']",It's an elevated covered roadway somewhat similar to elevated train tracks but it's for bicycles and it has a bunch of fans to provide an artificial tailwind to provide a speed comparable to cars in a congested urban setting.
6189,222,19,"['train', 'speed']",My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.

There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter."
6197,223,10,"['train', 'ground']",I would love to see a light rail system in my community. I am thinking of above ground trains that would run to the various suburbs and take people to various local stops. These trains should run a regular schedule so people can use them to commute.

6206,224,10,"['train', 'subway']","I live in a town with a lot of freight trains. A subway system would be nice because it would get us places faster (the town is large in size and spread out over several miles) and be able to bypass the trains, which stop constantly.

Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available.

Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way.

Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

If we took small platforms (about the size of the floor of a train car) and set them up with superconductors to allow levitation, the platforms could move along on enclosed rails and move slowly enough that people can hop on and off at platforms with no danger. The entire system could be above street level. The speed would be about 5 mph with platforms every block."
6865,357,3,"['town', 'trolley']","The neighborhood I live in has alley ways behind our properties. So when getting kids to school in our town, we could have some sort of trolley or train-like vehicle that could go up and down the alleys picking up the kids. This would be quick and efficient and the kids would want to go to school because it would be fun and exciting."
6866,358,3,"['town', 'airport']","An underground system in my small town like a subway. But instead of a subway underground, it would be those moving sidewalks you see in the airports that you could walk or glide quickly from place to place."
6867,358,3,"['town', 'airport']",monorail high speed that takes your from the north side of town to the south side and all the way to the airport
6868,358,3,"['town', 'airport']","My idea would be to use a moving belt (like used in airport terminals) instead of sidewalks to get around my neighborhood. I live is a small town (population about 500), so it would encourage people to drive less to get to destinations that are close to their homes."
6869,359,3,"['town', 'parking']",I think that an interesting mode of transport in my mountain town would be a ski lift type system that runs behind the businesses on main street and stops at every corner. The reason for this is our huge lack of parking and the congestion that cars cause in the shopping district. It would be unusual and fun and it could connect to the large parking area at the convention center.
6870,359,3,"['town', 'parking']","Many people in my town already ride bicycles to and from work or to run errands, and quite frankly I wish more of them would.  I live on a peninsula, so everyone is always competing for parking anyway.  I think bicycles are ideal for commuting in a smallish town like mine."
6871,359,3,"['town', 'parking']","This idea would have to be built in a city near a river, or attached to a solar farm because it relies on using naturally produced hydroelectric or solar power. Basically, it's a train on an electrified track, that moves slowly and stops at intervals in a big loop throughout a city. It would make stops the same way buses make stops. If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."

6876,361,3,"['town', 'subway']","I have seen a lot on the news lately about 'self-driving' cars, and I think it would be neat if this technology could someday be applied to public transportation. I think 'self driving' buses would be an excellent mode of transportation. I think this would be particularly useful for smaller cities or towns that can't afford to have subway systems. Self driving buses could be programmed to stop at every stop timely and efficiently and could save the city money by eliminating the need to hire drivers and would cut out the issue of human error when it comes to being on time, not showing up for work, or causing accidents."
6877,361,3,"['town', 'subway']","I live in a town with a lot of freight trains. A subway system would be nice because it would get us places faster (the town is large in size and spread out over several miles) and be able to bypass the trains, which stop constantly. The subway would run either over the existing trains or under them and run off of cards that were prepaid like the MTAs."
6878,362,9,"['bicycle', 'scooter']","A rental system for electric scooters and regular bicycles where you can drop it off at any local dropoff venues (bars, stores, etc). Pay by hours. An app with a map that shows all options, and also has ride-sharing help."

6900,365,4,"['bicycle', 'parking']",The idea is that free long term parking is offered at multiple nodes throughout the outskirts of the city. Within the city there are three primary modes of transport: public bicycles (if needed) for short distances between bus stops for medium distances and at key points throughout the city train stations for the longest stretches for cross city travel.
6901,366,3,"['bicycle', 'speed']",A sidewalk that is automatic.  It could allow people to get around faster than what walking would do.  It also would help others with being able to carry things that they couldn't possibly carry all by themselves.  It could help with getting people where they need to go at the rate of speed as a bicycle.  This would help out tons of people that have had a rough tiring day but don't want to use a vehicle to get back home.

Cars would be there for longer trips, but I would also like to see normal bicycle travel increase in the small city I live in. People are fat, lazy, and gross. We don't need anymore technology to go 100 yards, just less lazy people."
6936,381,2,"['bicycle', 'cars']",This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.

I imagine a rental system so that you could pick one up at a train or bus station to go your extra distance and return it when you return.

One thing that may be neat would be large sidewalks where people could ride bikes/scooters/walk and avoid using a vehicle. The main road is fairly busy, and there are quite a few shops around that would be more accessible if we had better transportation than just getting in a car! (Boardman, OH). Little scooters with solar power charging stations would be neat."

6945,383,7,"['station', 'downtown']","An electric monorail with a few cars that travel between the shopping center about a mile a way from us through the little downtown and stopping at the regional rail station a mile the other direction from us. It would have 2 or 3 trains that run back and forth all day and night transporting people between those two major zones in our neighborhood, eliminating the need for cars to travel nearby."
6946,383,7,"['station', 'downtown']","I often thought that a sort of ski lift-type system would work well to carry people from my neighborhood to downtown.  You would board a continuously running chair on wire, and then would be transported to a downtown station riding on the chair over the city. Would take ten minutes max to board and 10-15 minutes to go downtown."
6947,383,7,"['station', 'downtown']","I think high-speed tube travel would be great in my city. The tubes could be a system of plastic or rubber tubes that were buried underground. There would be a lot of tube stations downtown, but they would branch off to the outer city and suburbs. These tubes would have pods in them that were propelled by high-pressured air.

6951,384,5,"['station', 'subway']",Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.  The current system runs point to point and doesn't reduce car trips to the grocery store and local mall.
6952,384,5,"['station', 'subway']","Fully automated system of public transit; similar in function to a subway but smaller and without drivers (more like the automated tram systems used at airports). Probably using driverless car technology so it could utilize existing roadways? You would use a passcard to enter a specialized waiting area, like a covered bus stop, at which the driverless vehicle/tram/etc would stop at and allow entry (only to those allowed into the station; maybe functions like the turnstiles in a subway?). Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new. It would be more reliable than a bus system, which is rarely on time where I live, but more accessible than a subway/railway, which does not reach enough areas of my city for me to use frequently."
6953,384,5,"['station', 'subway']",I think we could bring back the streetcar in queens where the subway has low coverage. The streetcar would connect to the subway system which would be entirely rebuilt to accommodate new clean stations with solar panels and zero carbon foot print.

Ride sharing is also available. These cars can have a pod design, though larger vehicles are available for people who need to transport larger items or many items. They accept voice commands, so programming is easy, and the cars can take you to almost any destination. Links to other transportation hubs, like trains and buses, are also available.

Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it.

It has specific path made only for this vehicle like a railway track. The track has frictionless surface. The bottom of the vehicle is also frictionless. The vehicle does not have round wheels. But instead flat frictionless bottom (but also can be frictionless wheel). Vehicle does not need fuel. First we clips the vehicle to the track manually. We sit and unclip the vehicle from the track and apply some mechanical force just like in the bicycle to move forward. After that the vehicle moves without any force. Because there is no friction.We just sit and relax. When we apply brake, clips is attached the bottom of track and it stops. The track should be spread all across the city. Vehicle is portable.

The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off.

Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new.

However, despite the grid layout of the town, there is a diagonal irrigation canal running from the northwest corner to the southeast corner. Currently it has some poorly maintained walking paths, but that's about the extent of its development. Now, in the desert, loss of irrigation water to evaporation under the glaring sun is an issue. I'd propose creating a covered walkway/bike path where solar panels provide protection to the water, as well as pedestrians and cyclists. We could even use that solar energy to create small electric scooter rental/charging booths. It would provide a shortcut - a green highway from one end of town to the other."

But there are plenty of people who would use a rural bus . A bus could pick up multiple people in the rural area.

7859,1178,1,"['transportation', 'parking', 'equipment']","Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."

If you rode it long enough, you'd wind up at the same stop you got on at.  It relies completely on green energy, no exhaust just some electric motors driving the cars. People would be able to get on and just ride to where they needed to get off, leaving their personal vehicle in a parking area. It could be configured to have small, individual cars maybe fitted with a GPS system so you could tell it where you needed to go and it would get you as close as possible. The main idea is it would be free and the city could tax businesses a small amount for serving their parts of town, just to help pay maintenance costs."

Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new.

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on.

Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way.

Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."

There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car.
