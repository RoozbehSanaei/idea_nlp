A direct interaction between the adaptor protein Cbl-b and the kinase zap-70 induces a positive signal in T cells .
Engagement of the T-cell receptor ( TCR ) -CD3 complex induces a rapid increase in the activities of Src-family and Syk\/Zap-70-family kinases -LCB- 1 -RCB- -LCB- 2 -RCB- .
These activated kinases then induce the tyrosine phosphorylation of multiple intracellular proteins , eventually leading to T-cell activation .
One of the prominent substrates for these kinases is the adaptor protein Cbl -LCB- 3 -RCB- and recent studies suggest that Cbl negatively regulates upstream kinases such as Syk and Zap-70 -LCB- 4 -RCB- -LCB- 5 -RCB- .
Cbl-b , a homologue of Cbl , is widely expressed in many tissues and cells including hematopoietic cells -LCB- 6 -RCB- -LCB- 7 -RCB- .
Cbl-b undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation upon stimulation of the TCR and cytokine receptors -LCB- 8 -RCB- -LCB- 9 -RCB- .
The role of Cbl-b is unclear , however .
Here , we show that overexpression of Cbl-b in T cells induced the constitutive activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) .
A loss-of-function mutation in Cbl-b disrupted the interaction between Cbl-b and Zap-70 and nearly completely abrogated the Cbl-b-mediated activation of NFAT .
Unlike the proposed role of Cbl as a negative regulator , our results suggest that the Cbl homologue Cbl-b has a positive role in T-cell signaling , most likely via a direct interaction with the upstream kinase Zap-70 .
