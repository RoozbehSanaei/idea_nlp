Involvement of intracellular Ca2+ in oxidant-induced NF-kappa B activation .
In human Jurkat T cells and its subclone Wurzburg cells oxidant challenge elevated -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i by mobilizing Ca2+ from intracellular stores .
In Jurkat cells this effect was rapid and transient , but in Wurzburg cells the response was slow and sustained .
H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation in Wurzburg cells was not influenced by the presence of extracellular EGTA but was totally inhibited in cells that were loaded with esterified EGTA .
In Jurkat cells that are not sensitive to H2O2-induced NF-kappaB activation , H2O2 potentiated NF-kappaB activation in the presence of sustained high -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i following thapsigargin treatment .
NF-kappaB regulatory effect of alpha-lipoate and N-acetylcysteine appeared to be , at least in part , due to their ability to stabilize elevation of -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i following oxidant challenge .
Results of this study indicate that a sustained elevated -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i is a significant factor in oxidant-induced NF-kappaB activation .
