Regulation of -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i rise activated by doxepin-sensitive H1-histamine receptors in Jurkat cells , cloned human T lymphocytes .
To clarify the presence of histamine receptor and its transmembrane mechanism in human T lymphocytes , we investigated the effects of agonists or antagonists of histamine receptor subtypes and bacterial toxins on intracellular concentration of Ca2+ -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i ) , -LCB-3H-RCB-pyrilamine binding and c-fos mRNA expression in Jurkat cells , cloned human T lymphocytes .
H1-agonists ( histamine and 2-methylhistamine ) caused a transient rise of -LCB-Ca2+-RCB- , and H1-antagonists ( pyrilamine and doxepin ) inhibited the histamine-induced -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i rise more potently than the H2-antagonist ( cimetidine ) on the H3-antagonist ( impromidine ) .
Binding parameters of -LCB-3H-RCB-pyrilamine binding were Kd = 5.53 nM and Bmax = 2 , 647 sites\/cell .
Pretreatment with B.pertussis , V.cholera. or C.botulinum toxin did not influence histamine-induced -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i rise .
Western Blot analysis using antibodies against subunits of GTP-binding proteins indicated that Gq\/G11 richly existed in Jurkat cells .
Histamine induced mRNA expression of an immediate early gene c-fos .
Pretreatment with a protein kinase C activator , phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate , caused almost complete inhibition of histamine-induced -LCB-Ca2+-RCB-i rise , but did not do so by activators of cAMP- and cGMP-dependent protein kinases .
