"Something like this could be the personal transportation of the future. You'd have to eliminate a lot of safety issues, but a personal transporter that doesn't require the use of roads, or create traffic jams could be amazing. Cold fusion technology might make this possible, or the EMDrive"
"So in this idea you have a train system, but cars joining the existing train are accelerated prior to joining a constantly moving train.  This means the train effectively never stops to pick up passengers.  It just releases cars onto slipways.  It makes the trains completely reliable to within minutes"
auto |very nice survey for this world.
"I didn't know a proper way to convey this in a picture, so I drew up a subway map for a small town. I'm from a small town about an hour away from Dallas, Texas. It PAINS me knowing that the only public transportation exists only for major cities. Those of us with car problems end up with no other options for transportation. I would love to have an underground system for smaller connecting cities, and also a larger train system to get between major cities."
