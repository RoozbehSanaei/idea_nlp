drone,33333396,A flying bike that can come straight to you with a click of a button from your phone or tablet.
standard train,33334698,"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
standard train,33333413,A high-speed rail that goes around the neighborhood into the city.
drone,33334699,"A human carrying drone. This would require it to be build and withstand certain weight thresholds, such as up to 200 pounds. You would call a drone in and let it know where you want to go. It would pick you up and fly you there at a decent rate of speed and without having to sit in traffic."
taxi,33333424,A human taxi system like they have in Asian countries. A guy can run around with a cart and pick up passengers.
standard train,33333437,"A magnetic railway car, like a trolley, that moves and stops by people pressing buttons on the side of the road"
novel track type,33333550,A station with a tube in the ground with a high speed pod that would shoot me at a quick speed across the city or across the country in a couple hours. It would be faster than an airplane and safer too.
ride sharing,33334700,"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."
standard bus,33333716,Busses that come by every 15 minutes to popular spots on campus. Make the schedule more on time and more available to students.
ride sharing,33334701,"Car sharing. Everyone can join a club which has some monthly fee, let's say $100. If they pay this, then they find someone who lets them ride everyday with them to work and back home. They driver gets most of the money (the rest goes to overhead) and takes them to and from work everyday. So I guess it's like a taxi service with a monthly fee, hopefully that using people that work with you at your job."
novel track type,33334702,"Change the road into a high speed moving floor, like what they have at airport terminals but faster and with chairs to sit in.

ride sharing,33334715,"I think having a streetcar system would be amazing, it could be automated to accept fares, and would provide safe transportation for all."
standard bus,33334704,"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
standard train,33334092,I would love to see a light rail system in my community. I am thinking of above ground trains that would run to the various suburbs and take people to various local stops. These trains should run a regular schedule so people can use them to commute.
ride sharing,33334705,"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"

standard train,33334314,"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
standard bus,33334815,"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."

ride sharing,33334711,"Something like Uber or Lyft, but for getting kids to school. This way it's on an as needed basis rather than paying a flat fee for bus service that may not always be used for one reason or another. Especially when the child is staying late for practice or what not."

solar,33334679,we introduce solar vehicles.
,33334583,This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
,33334584,This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.

,33334587,"Ticket sharing system for people who make infrequent trips into the city, or suddenly need to do several trips in a row.

,33334588,To reduce gridlock and rush hour traffic governments should offer tax incentives for employers offering a staggered work day. I.e. Employees scheduled to be gin work at different times rather than the 7-10 o'clock  morning hour.
