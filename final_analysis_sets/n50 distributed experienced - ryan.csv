self-driving cars,4444458,"A series of small, 2-seater autonomous electric vehicles designed to transport people, on call, to the regular bus routes that already run.  Think of them as the vehicular solution to the 'last mile problem'. This would allow people to completely dispose of their cars, while allowing people with little mobility to utilize the bus system.  Because the autonomous system is limited to the neighborhood -- i.e. roads where the speed limit is, at a maximum, 25 mph -- the vehicles can be pretty lightweight, since they won't have to deal with the problem of high-speed crashes.  Being autonomous, the vehicles can be used by *anyone* of any age. Because they are electrically powered, they place no additional hydrocarbons in the atmosphere.  Because they are in the neighborhoods, they place the bus system within everyone's reach.  Because everyone can use them, day or night, the number of cars on the road can be reduced substantially, thus reducing the hydrocarbon emission problem considerably.  Reducing the number of cars on the roadways make *every* neighborhood 'walkable': the dream of urban planners everywhere. The vehicles could be assembled and maintained locally, therefore  providing local employment. Funding could come out of already-existing local transportation millages: reducing local pollution rates would increase local property values. A small investment in this innovative solution could result in a large increase of the quality of life for everyone!"

teleport,4444496,Cell phone teleport
safety,4444532,"I believe that there should be a police cars that have the ability to take control over other vehicles. For instance, if a criminal is speeding down a highway, then there should be a way to highjack that car in order to ensure the safety for other citizens."
self-driving cars,4444463,A system with auto mated self driving vehicles powered by cold fusion technology

service - renting,4444535,"I envision a bike rack where you can check out bikes that also have an electric motor.  You swipe your credit card (or some sort of near field smartphone transaction, etc) and pay a small rental fee.  If the bike is lost or stolen your card will be charged appropriately.  You can ride around the downtown, college campus, etc, and at the end of the day check the bike back into another (or the same) bike rack."

The traveler gets off and enters another automated taxi, which finishes taking him/her to the destination."

standard train,4444491,bullet train running straight up and down the west coast would be super popular.
standard bus,4444530,"I believe a rail car in the middle of the road would be great to take you from one part of the city to the other. This would obey normal traffic rules, but would be a no to low cost solution to transportation that would also drastically decrease DUI and traffic incidents due to alcohol."
standard train,4444540,I imagine a world where there are high speed rails all over my neighborhood. People will be travel in public transportation in a fast and effective manner to anywhere they want.
