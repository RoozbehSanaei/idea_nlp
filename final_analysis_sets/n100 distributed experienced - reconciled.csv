self-driving cars,4444458,"A series of small, 2-seater autonomous electric vehicles designed to transport people, on call, to the regular bus routes that already run.  Think of them as the vehicular solution to the 'last mile problem'. This would allow people to completely dispose of their cars, while allowing people with little mobility to utilize the bus system.  Because the autonomous system is limited to the neighborhood -- i.e. roads where the speed limit is, at a maximum, 25 mph -- the vehicles can be pretty lightweight, since they won't have to deal with the problem of high-speed crashes.  Being autonomous, the vehicles can be used by *anyone* of any age. Because they are electrically powered, they place no additional hydrocarbons in the atmosphere.  Because they are in the neighborhoods, they place the bus system within everyone's reach.  Because everyone can use them, day or night, the number of cars on the road can be reduced substantially, thus reducing the hydrocarbon emission problem considerably.  Reducing the number of cars on the roadways make *every* neighborhood 'walkable': the dream of urban planners everywhere. The vehicles could be assembled and maintained locally, therefore  providing local employment. Funding could come out of already-existing local transportation millages: reducing local pollution rates would increase local property values. A small investment in this innovative solution could result in a large increase of the quality of life for everyone!"

human powered,4444479,"An innovative transportation system in my neighborhood would be piggy-back rides.  It would be not only helpful to young and old alike, but a great strengthening exercise.  It's a small community where carrying people down the street to the library or up the street to the hospital would be an excellent way to build inner personal relationships between neighbors."

Along way it will pick up other riders heading same direction, drop off and pick up within 1/2 mile or so of. Combines bus/torlley service (running fixed route every 10 mins) with uber convenience, pickup at your door. and drop off at location."
standard rail system,4444523,"Hey, how about a monorail system!  I'm not kidding.  It's not just for Disney anymore.  My city runs basically on a north-south and east-west grid, main streets running parallel about two miles apart on both axes.  Four routes east-west and four routes north-south should just about do it.  Trams or mini-busses at each monorail stop for a comprehensive public transportation system.  We are in the Sun Belt, why not use solar to power the electric monorail.  It is the twenty-first century.  This idea has been on my mind for decades.  It might not work for everywhere, but it could work here, and quite a few other places I suppose."

tubes,4444529,Human-sized pneumatic tube transport. People would step into human-sized transport cylinders which would then be sent to their final destination through a network of pneumatic tubes that run beneath the city streets. This transport method was used extensively in the past for smaller scale items like mail and small packages. There is no reason it couldn't be scaled up to transport people as well. This concept could be compared to the proposed Hyperloop but on a smaller scale to transport idividuals over shorter distances within a city.
standard rail system,4444530,"I believe a rail car in the middle of the road would be great to take you from one part of the city to the other. This would obey normal traffic rules, but would be a no to low cost solution to transportation that would also drastically decrease DUI and traffic incidents due to alcohol."

flying,4444534,"I did not see your previous task, so this is my first idea.  It would be computer controlled drones arriving at you front door.  They would be equipped with a compartment below the four horizontal propellers.  It would have a capacity for one person with one carry on.  There would be lanes in the ""mind"" of the computer that would coordinate altitudes so that the vehicle would avoid other vehicles and elevated objects such as trees and high wires.  The vehicle would take the person to a central station where mass transit such as a train would collect riders."
service - renting,4444535,"I envision a bike rack where you can check out bikes that also have an electric motor.  You swipe your credit card (or some sort of near field smartphone transaction, etc) and pay a small rental fee.  If the bike is lost or stolen your card will be charged appropriately.  You can ride around the downtown, college campus, etc, and at the end of the day check the bike back into another (or the same) bike rack."

standard rail system,4444539,"I imagine a trolley going around the block. Going slowly to encourage people to get on. It can become a great place for teenagers aswell as other people to ride around in it and such. The tracks can be made out of solar panels and whenever there is darkness, such as a child fall on too the tracks. Then the trolley will stop. Safe and convienient."
standard rail system,4444540,I imagine a world where there are high speed rails all over my neighborhood. People will be travel in public transportation in a fast and effective manner to anywhere they want.
