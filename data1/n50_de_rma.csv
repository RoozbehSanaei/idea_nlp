safety,4444457,A sensor that let's the parent/ driver know that their child's car seat is properly installed
self-driving cars,4444486,Autonomous  vehicles that drive themselves on a smart transportation grid.  Need to go somewhere call for a vehicle tyo pick you up. Most local transport can be done without a personal car.
self-driving cars,4444465,"A traveler uses an app or calls a number to set up a pickup location and destination. An automated taxi picks the traveler up and takes him/her to a hub. The traveler transfers onto a sky train. The sky train is either a fast monorail or a helicopter. The sky train departs to a hub closest to the destination. The traveler gets off and enters another automated taxi, which finishes taking him/her to the destination."
self-driving cars,4444458,"A series of small, 2-seater autonomous electric vehicles designed to transport people, on call, to the regular bus routes that already run.  Think of them as the vehicular solution to the 'last mile problem'. This would allow people to completely dispose of their cars, while allowing people with little mobility to utilize the bus system.  Because the autonomous system is limited to the neighborhood -- i.e. roads where the speed limit is, at a maximum, 25 mph -- the vehicles can be pretty lightweight, since they won't have to deal with the problem of high-speed crashes.  Being autonomous, the vehicles can be used by *anyone* of any age. Because they are electrically powered, they place no additional hydrocarbons in the atmosphere.  Because they are in the neighborhoods, they place the bus system within everyone's reach.  Because everyone can use them, day or night, the number of cars on the road can be reduced substantially, thus reducing the hydrocarbon emission problem considerably.  Reducing the number of cars on the roadways make *every* neighborhood 'walkable': the dream of urban planners everywhere. The vehicles could be assembled and maintained locally, therefore  providing local employment. Funding could come out of already-existing local transportation millages: reducing local pollution rates would increase local property values. A small investment in this innovative solution could result in a large increase of the quality of life for everyone!"
self-driving cars,4444499,Combine the new driverless car technology with a bus.  Create an app that people use to communicate with the bus and schedule rides.  The app could track their location and do calculations for where everyone is and wants to go then create the shortest and fastest route.  When there are no more riders the bus could park its self.
self-driving cars,4444513,"Free parking for self driving cars. Each family could use one car that would drive them around and then go to a designated spot nearby to wait. In it's downtime, it could even act as cab for other people so families could make more money."

service - renting,4444535,"I envision a bike rack where you can check out bikes that also have an electric motor.  You swipe your credit card (or some sort of near field smartphone transaction, etc) and pay a small rental fee.  If the bike is lost or stolen your card will be charged appropriately.  You can ride around the downtown, college campus, etc, and at the end of the day check the bike back into another (or the same) bike rack."
service - renting,4444460,"A simple bicycle exchange and rental program that works on a library card system. Bicycles are locked up around the city, and there are stations for returning bikes in padlocks. The whole system is operated by swiping a public library card."

standard bus,4444530,"I believe a rail car in the middle of the road would be great to take you from one part of the city to the other.

standard bus,4444473,Alternative transportation could be taking a trolley that would be the same cost as a local bus .
standard bus,4444454,A public bus transport system that will alllow commuters to get from point A to point B. This will allow for citizens to save money and be energy efficient.
standard bus,4444484,"Automated high-density, elongated cars."
standard train,4444477,An electromagnetic solar powered monorail. Its only a means to replace a standard city beltway people would commute to parking lots and take the rail to the inner city where it would connect with the local subway and bus system for extentability.
