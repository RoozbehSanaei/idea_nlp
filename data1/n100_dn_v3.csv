flying wearable,33334596,"Transportation is mostly done by cars nowadays, but why don't we use rocket powered shoes instead? Flying with footwear is not only cool, it would be much faster than driving."
service - renting,33334597,Transportation that would allow people to rent out electric self driving cars. This would let people have cars pick them up at whatever location they want and have the car autonomously drive to their destination. Similar to a fleet of self driving electric taxis. This would greatly reduce the cost of transportation in my opinion because people would not have to buy cars but could rather rent or lease them.
030noise,33334598,transportation vehicles
flying drone,33334599,Transportation would not be about getting the general population from home to work and back. It would be about moving goods and services to people directly.

sharing app,33334612,Uber for helicopters.
sharing app,33334613,"Uber is not currently available in my area, because it is not seen as a large enough ""metro"" area. I believe that if several of the small communities pooled together, there would be enough available and willing drivers to start a less urban and more suburban/rural version of a paid ridesharing service. Since the communities would be pooled, there would likely be drivers from many different areas of the community, so a larger geographic area could be served."
uber - bus,33334614,Uber like school bus system
sharing app,33334615,Uber limo. Essentially uber but for big groups of people that want to look like ballers.

sharing app,33334618,"Uber style delivery service. When someone needs something picked up (groceries, take out order, new TV, etc) they can use the Uber style app to let a driver know where and what needs picking up and where it needs to be delivered. This could be great for restaurants that don't deliver. If it's added as part of the Uber platform it could probably be cheaper than delivery fees from the places that deliver from restaurants"
sharing app,33334619,Uber-like service that has small personal celf-drive cars that are shared by the community. App interface to request a car and specify whether you are willing to share you car with a small number of other people

human powered,33334621,"Ultimate monkey bars.

standard bus,33334697,a bus that plays all 80s music all the time
standard bus,33334698,"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
flying drone,33334699,"A human carrying drone. This would require it to be build and withstand certain weight thresholds, such as up to 200 pounds. You would call a drone in and let it know where you want to go. It would pick you up and fly you there at a decent rate of speed and without having to sit in traffic."
sharing app,33334700,"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."

If they pay this, then they find someone who lets them ride everyday with them to work and back home.

service - sharing,33334703,Combining food delivery services with taxi driving to maximize efficiency.
standard bus,33334704,"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
service - sharing,33334705,"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"

Forget flying cars, late trains or other outdated modes of transport, and tele away with Telepads!"
reting bike,33334713,There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.

standard rail system,33334715,"I think having a streetcar system would be amazing, it could be automated to accept fares, and would provide safe transportation for all."

levitation,33334794,I imagine a magnetic public hovercraft system that goes to individual homes on a grid.
uber - bus,33334815,"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."
