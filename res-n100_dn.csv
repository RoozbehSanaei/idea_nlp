1,1,0,[],A flying bike that can come straight to you with a click of a button from your phone or tablet.
2,1,0,[],"A great mode of transportation in my neighborhood could be a bus or tram that runs along the local parkway (a road that basically goes across the whole town) people would be able to hop on it and ride it to their destination and be there within walking distance when getting off the bus/tram. Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical."
3,1,0,[],A high-speed rail that goes around the neighborhood into the city.
4,1,0,[],"A human carrying drone. This would require it to be build and withstand certain weight thresholds, such as up to 200 pounds. You would call a drone in and let it know where you want to go. It would pick you up and fly you there at a decent rate of speed and without having to sit in traffic."
5,1,0,[],A human taxi system like they have in Asian countries. A guy can run around with a cart and pick up passengers.
6,1,0,[],"A magnetic railway car, like a trolley, that moves and stops by people pressing buttons on the side of the road"
7,1,0,[],A station with a tube in the ground with a high speed pod that would shoot me at a quick speed across the city or across the country in a couple hours. It would be faster than an airplane and safer too.
8,1,0,[],"A way to connect your car with a mobile phone app - you would broadcast your intended route (such as commuting home from work) and share this route with people in your local area. For a small fee (under $5) - someone could ask to ""Ride Along"" with you along your route - but with no deviations - they would be allowed to get out along the way, but not change your intended path of travel."
9,1,0,[],Busses that come by every 15 minutes to popular spots on campus. Make the schedule more on time and more available to students.
10,1,0,[],"Car sharing. Everyone can join a club which has some monthly fee, let's say $100. If they pay this, then they find someone who lets them ride everyday with them to work and back home. They driver gets most of the money (the rest goes to overhead) and takes them to and from work everyday. So I guess it's like a taxi service with a monthly fee, hopefully that using people that work with you at your job."
11,1,0,[],"Change the road into a high speed moving floor, like what they have at airport terminals but faster and with chairs to sit in.  You can board a chair in a parking lot/driveway and operate a machine to choose destination.  The chair will then merge into the moving road and go for the destination."

15,1,0,[],I imagine a magnetic public hovercraft system that goes to individual homes on a grid.
16,1,0,[],"I think having a streetcar system would be amazing, it could be automated to accept fares, and would provide safe transportation for all."
17,1,0,[],"I think it would be great to have a jitney-type bus that you could hail like a cab directly from the street.  The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
18,1,0,[],I would love to see a light rail system in my community. I am thinking of above ground trains that would run to the various suburbs and take people to various local stops. These trains should run a regular schedule so people can use them to commute.
19,1,0,[],"I'm imagining a car sharing service with locations throughout the city where you can go pick up a car without having to reserve one in advance. Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"

23,1,0,[],my city needs a subway system badly. A subway system would run in a star shaped pattern through the city and eliminate the terrible traffic in my city
24,1,0,[],"My neighborhood will continue to use mainly personal vehicles as a mode of transportation, though the downtown area is working on an underground rail system."
25,1,0,[],"My small rural town doesn't even have an intact bus system, so anything would be better than it is now. But I would like a service that has people who drive pick up trucks to help you move things. For instance, if you go to the store and purchase a new couch, I'd like to have something like Uber for Pick Up Trucks to call and have them bring my sofa home so that I don't have to pay for outragious delivery fees from the store."
26,1,0,[],"Obviously teleportation would be awesome, like with portals to common places."

34,1,0,[],Smarter stop lights that are better at managing traffic congestion
35,1,0,[],"Something like Uber or Lyft, but for getting kids to school. This way it's on an as needed basis rather than paying a flat fee for bus service that may not always be used for one reason or another. Especially when the child is staying late for practice or what not."
36,1,0,[],"Telepads! The Transportation of the Future! Simply step on this portal pad, and you are instantly transported to your location! The movement of molecules into energy is completely safe, and many users only experience a minor burning sensation for a minute after the teleportation process. Forget flying cars, late trains or other outdated modes of transport, and tele away with Telepads!"
37,1,0,[],There should be a place to rent bicycles for a nominal fee for a day like they do in the big cities. You can rent a bicycle and return it to any place that also rents the same bicycles. You could also rent scooters to be able to do small errands around town.

44,1,0,[],we introduce solar vehicles.
45,1,0,[],This transportation system would be the most spectacular to the entire neighborhood. It is a neighborhood vehicle hub system. It is a hub where everyone with an android or ios or windows phone can open an app and rent out a car or a bike to use around the neighborhood with the additional benefit on these hubs being eco friendly public restrooms with vending machines for those that wish to travel locally and have the munchies.
46,1,0,[],This would be a bike lane that would be protected from other vehicles. It would make biking more safe and efficient. Bicycles would move in one road and cars would be on a different one. Cars would have to give the right of way to bicycles.
47,1,0,[],Three wheels auto two in back and one in front. 4 to 5 people can travel in it.
48,1,0,[],"Ticket sharing system for people who make infrequent trips into the city, or suddenly need to do several trips in a row. A group of people could collectively share a commuter pass for the train or bus system. It would be like a Netflix of commuter passes. The ticket could be held in an existing business or maybe a library, and the ticket would be checked out like a book. People would pay each day they hold the ticket."

55,1,0,[],"Transportation is mostly done by cars nowadays, but why don't we use rocket powered shoes instead? Flying with footwear is not only cool, it would be much faster than driving."
56,1,0,[],Transportation that would allow people to rent out electric self driving cars. This would let people have cars pick them up at whatever location they want and have the car autonomously drive to their destination. Similar to a fleet of self driving electric taxis. This would greatly reduce the cost of transportation in my opinion because people would not have to buy cars but could rather rent or lease them.
57,1,0,[],transportation vehicles
58,1,0,[],Transportation would not be about getting the general population from home to work and back. It would be about moving goods and services to people directly.This will require drone technologiy so that road infrastructure could be used to get bulk items from one place to another more efficiently and faster. Public transportation should be the rule.

64,1,0,[],"Tunnels, a series of tunnels to and from various nodes around the neighborhood, with access at most corners. These would have flat conveyors to make movement faster than normal walking much like in airports but also be underground to be out of the way and avoid unpleasant weather."
65,1,0,[],Uber bus.
66,1,0,[],Uber carpooling: People who are going to a similar destination can choose to carpool.

68,1,0,[],Uber for helicopters.
69,1,0,[],"Uber is not currently available in my area, because it is not seen as a large enough ""metro"" area. I believe that if several of the small communities pooled together, there would be enough available and willing drivers to start a less urban and more suburban/rural version of a paid ridesharing service. Since the communities would be pooled, there would likely be drivers from many different areas of the community, so a larger geographic area could be served."
70,1,0,[],Uber limo. Essentially uber but for big groups of people that want to look like ballers.
71,1,0,[],uber lyft or any taxi cabs we are a rural area very large and towns near or past 30 min away from eachother. having a taxi service would be very appreciative and would also bring more jobs locally throughout the whole southern part of this state really/

73,1,0,[],"Uber style delivery service. When someone needs something picked up (groceries, take out order, new TV, etc) they can use the Uber style app to let a driver know where and what needs picking up and where it needs to be delivered. This could be great for restaurants that don't deliver. If it's added as part of the Uber platform it could probably be cheaper than delivery fees from the places that deliver from restaurants"
74,1,0,[],Uber-like service that has small personal celf-drive cars that are shared by the community. App interface to request a car and specify whether you are willing to share you car with a small number of other people
75,1,0,[],Uberbus. Uber hiring for large amounts of people to be transported.
76,1,0,[],"Ultimate monkey bars.  People are too fat in my area, forcing them to travel via monkey bars across the neighborhood should help not only with emission decrease, but weight decrease as well!  There will just be an overhead system running the lengths of the sidewalks at 7 foot high so no one gets hurt if they fall."

89,1,0,[],"Using autonomous cars/vehicles as taxis that you can rent and have escort you anywhere you would like to go in your area. Cars will be equipped with GPS so customers can log where their destinations, etc."
90,1,0,[],using Biogas as fuel are also good innovative thing which makes goood transportation system .
91,1,0,[],Using boats to travel in Miami to beat the rush hour traffic. It's quite simple to travel anywhere in Miami by using the canals and various waterways. Boats or ferries should be used not just for sight seeing but for public transportation.

Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental. Things like insurance and billing info would all be done upfront when a patron sets up an account. This is genius, the more i think about it!"

The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."
