Whenever an object passes over the air pockets, they rapidly self inflate, thereby pushing the slip and slide canoe further and faster.",,4

856,,33334738,It would be like a super fast tram or train so the people in my neighborhood could get to run errands without their cars. We could have stops at the entrances to the neighborhood and the tracks could just run down the street.,,4

455,,33333792,Express subway lines would be nice.  WMATA is a terrible system.  But I'd be happy if we could get some sidewalks and bike lanes in our neighborhood.  A real help would be a circulator bus system for the neighborhoods surrounding our subway station.

We have 2 main roads that run through town so this would be very easy to implement.",,4
209,,33333544,"a solar powered train that gains energy from the sun from the solar panels on the top of the train. it would run from sun up to sun down, to make sure it always has a charge. it would be sort of like a troll, but go as fast as a train.",,4
961,,33334287,"My idea is a combination of self driving cars, rideshare and a train. Commuters would pay for a ticket and a line of connected self driving cars would take commuters going the same route/direction to a certain dropoff point, like a train does. Then when the string of cars reaches the stop point, each passenger can enter their desired destination into the touchpad screen in the car and they would be driven to their individual destinations. The self driving cars would break off individually from the train to take these passengers, then they'd return on their own to the ""train station"" to go pick up more passengers.",,4

1206,,33334519,"The suburbs are not currently served by the bus system. I believe that each suburb should get its own bus, which will take riders to a bus stop in the city. There, they may catch another bus or walk to their destination.",,4
823,,33334156,Instead of buses or trains that come at specific times there would be a looped track with chairs that circles the city constantly there would never be a wait as it would be running constantly.,,4

672,,33334003,I think that we need a rail system for our city. Its a growing city with lost of bigger cities around it. A main rail system like a subway would make things much easier to get from place to place.,,4
1217,,33334530,The van cars can be used as a means of transport for dropping people at scheduled times just like buses. They will have limited stops to minimize wait time and people using cars for nearby locations can use it instead of using cars personally or waiting for bus at bus stops which go stopping at all the bus stops.,,4
1213,,33334526,"The transportation system is much into the future where you get into a cylinder and press your destination on the buttons, somewhat like an elevator. The tube launches and within minutes, you arrive at your destination within the city limits. The cylinder, if you can imagine, is one like what you put your deposits in at a bank window.",,4
530,,33333862,Hoverboards that really move along and can occupy the bike lanes in some major cities would help unclog pedestrian side walks. Lnaes for Elf cars and Fred Flintstone type vehicles. More companies should be like Google and provide transportation for their employees. Hoover boats that glide across bays 10 times faster that farries plowing throw the water.,,4
46,,33333377,"A conveyor belt system like the airport set up like the nyc trains would be awesome.  A bit slow going, but cheap, affordable, and it would allow people to be out in the fresh air again.",,4
682,,33334015,"I think we should focus on making it easier for people to bike around the area. We need to widen sidewalks and/or have separate paths just for pedestrians and bikers. Oftentimes, the bike lanes are narrow or end abruptly.",,4

531,,33333863,"How about a deluxe line of buses. You have to pay 150 or above a month for a pass, but these run better routes, and they actually run on time. The regular monthly bus pass is 65, but the service is terrible. On this new route, absolutely no discounts, no half fares, no free rides. Always have security on the bus to get rid of the riff raff. This new deluxe bus wouldn't even share stops with the regular bus route.",,4
354,,33333686,Backpack rockets would be a great alternative to getting around this city. Since most places are within a 5 mile radius it would be a super convenient way to get around and would be totally affordable.,,4

755,,33334090,"I would love individual Segway transporters that would go from the house to the transit station.  They would just fit one person and keep them dry.  Only about 1 mile but just far enough in the rain not to walk.  Once at the transit station, the train takes you directly every 5 minutes into the city.",,4
674,,33334006,"I think there should be ""speed walking"" lanes set up.  Separate from where pedestrians walk and separate from bike trails.  I would love it if there were ""fast lanes"" around the strip malls and commercial areas of my city.  I tend to speed walk and get so frustrated with trying to dart and dodge around people.  It can almost be like an HOV lane for pedestrians for people who need to walk brisker and faster and get somewhere.  Even slow jogs or panicked gallops would be allowed!  When it's really crowded and busy on the streets, I always feel like a pinball ball.  I think having a dedicated lane to faster walkers or a ""passing lane"" would really help with the flow of pedestrian traffic and its effectiveness.",,4
24,,33333355,"a bus that has little cars in it to take people different places, and once it lets them out the car returns to the bus for others",,4
319,,33333654,"An uber-like system for public transit busses. Riders must request pick up 24 hours ahead of time, and the bus would come to their door or as close as it could to pick the rider up. The fare could be determined by how many riders requested pick up, and drop off to a central location (downtown). From there maybe there would be additional busses that go directly to drop off points rather than on a pre-set route.",,4
491,,33333828,Have an app for parents of kids who go to the same school where they can carpool and share rides to the same events. I live in a climate where these is severe weather so telling people to walk and ride bikes is only good in the summer!,,4
289,,33333621,"An alternative transport that would be excellent would be a monorail in my city.  It could be run with electricity, with many train cars, and go along the main north south route.  You could get almost anywhere in quickly and easily if it went along that route.",,4
169,,33333506,"A rail cart, that is powered by friction and capturing the head it produces while being driven down the rail, it starts with a simple pedal of a bike to create enough momentum and friction to start the process going and then as soon as you produce enough energy to get it moving, it will continue to produce and move forward till you press the brakes. BAM!",,4
1091,,33334416,"School Bus taxi. School buses rumble down our street every day, often not every seat is taken. If you knew the route, and had been vetted through security, you could pay a small fare to hop on and ride along the route, even connecting to other school buses. It would be an energy-efficient mode of transportation. Also, more adults on the bus would probably reduce bullying among the kids.",,4
133,,33333470,"A new transportation system  can be something somewhat like a train, but a small train like shuttle, which can take others around the neighborhood, easy, fast and no traffic.",,4
134,,33333471,"A new transportation system for my neighborhood would be a uber-like bus service. Buses have specific routes, and can stop at any point on that route if you use the service. That way you can have one pick you up close to your house instead of having to drop your car off at a bus station.",,4
663,,33333993,"I think that a trolly system would work well in phoenix.  They would run frequently, be smaller than a bus and go into more neighborhoods.",,4

989,,33334316,My new transportation system would be a golf cart system. We have many elderly people who would enjoy being able to get around using golf carts. It would be a wa around the city without having to use the highway.,,4
1165,,33334484,"Subways with shorter runs. NYC is filled with unused tunnels and stations. Get them up and running. Also, allow people who use any sort of wheel-based transport, that's not a bus or car, to use the bike lanes.",,4

Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about.",,7

You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.

Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go.

A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. 

While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way.

It would have a dedicated lane so traffic wouldn't affect the bus and vice versa.  There would be a way to quickly have people enter and exit the bus and this would keep it on time.  Of course the bus is electric powered.,,69

Of course space would be limited to about 2-3 bikes.,,69

Could be relatively cheap, clear up traffic with less people having to drive around, and is highly economical.",,69
652,,33333981,"I think high-speed tube travel would be great in my city. The tubes could be a system of plastic or rubber tubes that were buried underground. There would be a lot of tube stations downtown, but they would branch off to the outer city and suburbs. These tubes would have pods in them that were propelled by high-pressured air. The pods could be designed to carry one or two people each, and would be shot through the tubes for quick travel to your destination.",,69

That way you just get on the train, and the train goes to an interchange.

Once all the compartments that are going to the same area are together, the train leaves. It would work like changing trains, except you wouldn't have to go outside.",,69

People can just call one from an app on their smart phone, they are charged a small fee, then after the trip, the cart remains in one area until it is called again or it returns to the hub to be charged.",,69

The vehicles will have oppositely polarized magnets that will be controllable in the car.  I guess it will work like those trains that use magnets, but someone smart will figure out a way to control the magnets independently.  The car battery will power the magnet on the car, and can be shut off immediately once the power is cut in case of emergency.",,69
983,,33334310,My neighborhood has little walk-ability due to poor road quality and an abundance of speed bumps. My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.,,69

(Access would be prepaid and mediated by a RFID chip card and scanner on the devices.) These would probably move at about 5-10 miles per hour - faster than regular walking, but slower than other forms of transport that require more infrastructure and potential for danger. It'd kinda be like, Razor scooters but built into the city landscape and available at-will. Like a bike-share system, but always there and with no energy or exercise expended. This would be a great way for tired people to avoid walking, and would speed up trips to the closest subway station/bus stop.",,69

The busses would pick up and drop off and would take you to and from the monorail system.,,69
748,,33334082,"I would like to see magnet-driven trains that would not only connect all the part of my very spread out city, but also could connect the major cities in the state together. Ideally, these would be largely automated, but with several emergency safety features, like an onboard override cabin and override booths at each station. There would also have to be a central monitoring hub to keep an eye on the system in general, that in the city would likely have to be run underground, but above ground tracks would be possible between most cities, allowing passengers to avoid traffic and enjoy the wonderful views at the same time. Magnetic drive and perhaps even levitation would help with getting passengers around in snow storms, which often disrupt traffic here in the winter.",,69

613,,33333944,"I live in NYC. Travel is not too difficult, with the only real concern being the price of a subway ticket or a taxi ride. With more options, they become cheaper, but space is also an issue.

This would create tiers of roads to be used by trains, that would speed up and cheapen the overall problem.",,74
628,,33333958,"I see the potential for self-driving cars to replace taxi services. People would call an automated line, or perhaps interact with a site/app on their computers/phones, to schedule to be picked up by the service. Meanwhile, a network that keeps track of all self-driving cars in its region would figure out which car was closest or would have to deviate the least to pick up the passenger within 5-10 minutes of being hailed. These cars could be compartmentalized to hold four or six passengers without individuals having to worry about undesired contact with the other passengers. The cars could run on electricity and the network would consider battery life with regards to planning routes and destinations.",,74

I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants.",,74

I believe that the existing public transit should be expanded with a greater fleet of buses, so that all people in my community could be served.

1014,,33334341,"Our society's population is expanding at a rapid rate. The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime.",,74

If we installed vacuum tubes that led to a multitude of central destinations, we could develop a toll system alongside it. Using air pressure would cut out emissions immensely, and would be relatively fast, allowing for faster travel times than traditional modes of transportation. However, the difficulty would come from utilizing the system in such a way that remained safe for all those involved, perhaps through making use of a stop and go turbine system, that worked similarly to a stop light. A smart air restriction system would allow for one way travel, and then a short delay, followed by travel in the other direction.",,74

The companies could create specialized buses so that several people can ride, and can put their logo on the outside of the bus and could name the transportation something catchy using the company name so that word-of-mouth provides extra advertising.",,74

948,,33334274,My city is currently looking at High Occupancy Travel toll lanes.  I've thought that a dedicated lane for buses or van pools would be an alternative that could let the car commuters see the speed at which these other options can get to work.  This would encourage the use of the bus / van pool options.,,96

Besides the driver, the vehicles would only have space for two other occupants.  The vehicles would continue on the same busy stretch of road.  In other words, they would be on a fixed path.  Also, there would be a large number of these vehicles, a constant stream, so the passenger would never have to wait longer than a minute or two.
