Unique ID,Text: VerbatimM1,"Something like this could be the personal transportation of the future. You'd have to eliminate a lot of safety issues, but a personal transporter that doesn't require the use of roads, or create traffic jams could be amazing. Cold fusion technology might make this possible, or the EMDrive"M2,"So in this idea you have a train system, but cars joining the existing train are accelerated prior to joining a constantly moving train.  This means the train effectively never stops to pick up passengers.  It just releases cars onto slipways.  It makes the trains completely reliable to within minutes"M3,auto |very nice survey for this world.M4,"I didn't know a proper way to convey this in a picture, so I drew up a subway map for a small town. I'm from a small town about an hour away from Dallas, Texas. It PAINS me knowing that the only public transportation exists only for major cities. Those of us with car problems end up with no other options for transportation. I would love to have an underground system for smaller connecting cities, and also a larger train system to get between major cities."3392,"Magic flying carpet | Personal transport for 2020: Car>Ship>Self-airplane, Transformer 'CSP' | time travel machine"3386,"Driverless Car, GPS | Power skates/shoes - for individuals, hear individual's verbal instructions, GPS | Flying Car(Electric powered, no pollution), GPS"3387,Propeller Hat | Harry Potter Flying Broom | Flying Wheels3388,Electrical car w/o wheels | Bullet train | Mechanical Wings3389,"Lift sensors/ human beings within, automatically opens, button only inside | Dustbin(Sensors humans) auto-open to throw trash "3390,Bullet car | Sheltered bicycle | Superman/Glider/Cape3391,"MRT - extend cabin when crowded | Flying suit - reach a place with a touch of a button | Car - voice operated, bring you to the place "3393,Travelator along roads/ outdoor > increase speed of travelling > encourages travelling by foot > decreases carcon footprint! | Teleport here 3394,Motorised bicycle | No need transport > work from home teleconference | seat that can travel3395,"Personal speed boats, singapore river | MRT Ferry system, shelter | Flying cars, floats, wings, travel on sea too!"3396,"Motorised roller blades, to be allowed on the roads | High technology roads > Travellator roads | Bullet Train, magnetic repulsion "3397,"parachute with wind steering from my high story flat | electric, movable stand, park and go from place to place | wings, I can fly to where I want to go"3398,"Wheels in a bag, portable, easy to use | Pair of wings to each person, foldable wings that can be activated as and when we want, remote control the wings to attach it to the person | Designated road lanes for portable transport device.
