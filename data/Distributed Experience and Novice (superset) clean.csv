The jitney would be electric powered and follow a specific route.  I think this would be great because I live in a town that has many tourists, but does not have a large population.  It could shuttle tourists to different areas, but the tourists wouldn't have to worry about a specific bus schedule.  The jitney could drive on streets that are not bus-accessible (some of our streets are ""old world"" and very narrow). There is also some frustration in my town about not having a vibrant night life because of lack of public transportation.  This jitney would allow people to go downtown, especially college students, and have some drinks without worrying about driving.  One of the stops would be the college campus. The jitney would have a very low fair to encourage people not to drink and drive.  This jitney would help downtown businesses and restaurants."308XBLVESJFTH1CORZW9VC5N25MBRK,"There should be large carousel in the city that circles the block, so people just get on a horse and go where they can."308XBLVESJFTH1CORZW9VC5N2UFBRR,A system with auto mated self driving vehicles powered by cold fusion technology308XBLVESJFTH1CORZW9VC5N2WPBR5,"Telepads!

Nor would you have to interact with any people at the pickup/dropoff location. It would be somehow automated. Perhaps you would subscribe to the service an at annual or monthly rate and be given a special kind of 'key' that would give access to any of the cars currently at the pick up location. It would be first come first serve, and there would be smart technology embedded in both the cars and the keys. Your universal key would be linked to your account, and the car you used would transmit all relevant information to the system. Such as , time of pick up. number of miles drive. amount of gas used. Then the fees would be adjusted accordingly based on the type of car you used, miles driven, gas consumed etc. all of this without any human employees and all the fuss that comes with tradiional car rental.

This would cut down on neighborhood traffic and also be a safe mode of transportation for kids.

There are so many people who have cars and it would be a great option for people who don't have reliable access to one. It could use cell phone apps and perhaps even have a traditional component using telephone for people who are less technologically inclined. The biggest challenge would be safety/security, and I'm honestly not sure how to overcome that aspect. There could be specific stops, almost like bus stops, where people could gather and wait for rides, or schedule rides to pick them up at certain times."31T4R4OBOTR29NKFWLUY1FK5J2YC7B,Zipline rail.

A train that can transport passengers fast in between the major areas in the neighborhood, for example to schools, the downtown area, the performing arts theater, shopping districts, the airport etc. It doesn't have to stop very often like a bus but an instead be used for getting between major areas and can be supported by the bus system."31UV0MXWNRNEZMSW02BNEY445POI5H,An iphone app that scans items and gives you coupons.

We could use an updated rail system that would make traveling to our larger cities in the state faster, more available, and yet still affordable.  It could bring more people to live in our city if they could travel fast to the big city and help grow our town here.  Our town is terribly depressed and I think that having a high-speed train or just general more options to travel through it would bring a massive amount of revenue into the city."324G5B4FB4JIFVPZK51E6EI4A4370X,An UBer like system where neighbors help neighbors on a rotating basis.324G5B4FB4JIFVPZK51E6EI4A7T70T,"I feel like there could be a uber shuttle, sort of like a train system."324G5B4FB4JIFVPZK51E6EI4AA970F,I would like a taxi like system that doesn't charge so high.324G5B4FB4JIFVPZK51E6EI4AOT07K,we introduce some of the terms and techniques used in data communications in networks which range from transport to the internet326O153BMJ9XNU53JP3FRVU4QD4ED1,An app to help set up carpools.326O153BMJ9XNU53JP3FRVU4QJCEDL,Personal shopping service for seniors.

My Idea is simple in that they can add multiple lanes above the street for bikes and people walking. This would be on par with what cities have over major crossings but will cost relatively little money compared with adding a train or increasing the once daily buses. This would also allow any expansion of the roads under the walkways and reduce the 10 or so deaths a year from cars hitting people when they are just walking on the side of the road.32Z9ZLUT1MV0B1NUZZP1NS3GM78HOM,I think we should use a monorail like system to easily get around the suburbs and greater university section of the town.32Z9ZLUT1MV0B1NUZZP1NS3GMN6OHN,A simple roapway made up of strong steel cable and a cabin controlled by rope.

Not cars though, more like carriages driven by AI ""Horses"" (Imagine that new Harley electric motorcycle engine, in a short, small, bullet shaped car like you used to see on the SIDE of a motorcycle, pulling a carriage, with an AI brain controlling it). A system like this would have the novelty and functionality of pulling people when you wanted to, or you could just use the AI 'sidecar' to run courier errands on the ground for companies that wanted fast delivery. Think like Amazon drones without the flying, the noise or the whole 'being small enough to get shot down by a .22 and stolen' thing. It keeps the battery away from the passengers if there is ever a crash, too. Which is good because those things can explode sometimes. The best thing about it, though? When it's just moving small items around for parcel delivery, it's not wasting fuel hauling an empty cab around with it. I can't stand seeing people waste so much energy driving a giant SUV around with no passengers or cargo. That act alone should be a top priority for politicians pushing for environmental reform to be talking about."37XITHEISXKCR64U5ZS46WB5KHVCRJ,I could see a trolley style system that ran on solar panels so that there would be no wires hanging.37XITHEISXKCR64U5ZS46WB5KOQRC7,"The way that most people travel is an invisible bridge.

Vehicle would be the size of a small city bus but could connect to some city-run data network to find and avoid traffic stops and slowdowns (and use/switch between already existing bus lanes and subway tracks?). It could have its own roadway/railway too but it would be nice to not have to create something new.

Everything would be rentable using an app and the cars would feature opening the doors and starting the cars through the app itself.3FE2ERCCZYJSOILIICX6W1578KIPO7,"The city has recently built a set of rollerblade kiosks that allow people to rent skates in their size.

You would walk/visit some sort of kiosk, swipe your card and it would unlock a bicycle from a rack.  You are then free to ride it.  You can then return it to the same kiosk, or perhaps to one further away/new destination and as long as you swipe the credit card again upon returning the bike -- it would clear your deposit.   If you don't return the bike within a reasonable amount of time (say 2 days or so), you could charge the person the price of the bike plus some penalty.   This method won't make much money if free, but you could also setup a rental type system.   Just imagine lots of kiosks around a city, with say 12 or so bikes are each one, and people could rent/ride as needed.  Like a Uhaul type service for bikes.   From a network perspective, I guess it would be like sending a packet to a new location downstream, and the returning of the bike would be the acknowledgment.    If you don't return the bike, it would charge your card aka ask for a retransmission of said packet.  That's all I have for now."3L2IS5HSFBTNY2T2YJWNRIS1QXRNUK,"A new transportation system in my neigborhood would consist of more bike lanes, pedestrian lanes, and an extensive carpool/ride sharing system.

However, the difficulty would come from utilizing the system in such a way that remained safe for all those involved, perhaps through making use of a stop and go turbine system, that worked similarly to a stop light.

The typical modern day modes of transportation, while convenient, have a few downsides.  Every mean of transportation, with the exception of walking, has costs that come with it.  This ranges from having to pay for the cost of gas to paying the physical price of not getting the proper amount of exercise our bodies where meant to have via walking to our destinations. There is one option that could solve these issues.  Imagine a small grass field, similar to the ones you find at playgrounds, with a small parking lot.  Within this parking lot would be a couple of electric powered cars attached to power stations. These setups would be available every few blocks (about as frequent as modern bus-stops). Within the field beside the cars stations would be stationary work out equipment. These would be modeled after the free-to-use exercise stations in places like China. They would have equipment such as: bench presses, ellipticals, bikes, etc.  All of these would be wired underground to the charging station attached to the cars. The energy created from the movement of each device will directly charge the cars in the station.  Off to the side of each piece of equipment would be a touchscreen. A person can set up an account at their local government buildings, providing a valid driver's license,e-mail address, and credit or debit card number. When signed in, each account can track how much a person exercised and convert it to an 'available miles for usage' number.  This means that the more a person uses this equipment, creating more energy for the cars, the more miles the person would be allowed to use the car for.  This however also means, that prior to using the car they would have to deduct the amount of miles they plan to use from their account.  If the person should go over their allotted miles, they will then be subsequently charged on their provided credit card.  This encourages people to work-out more at these stations, so they can avoid the fees for using the car. This set-up would immensely help those who financially can't afford their own form of transportation, while promoting a healthier lifestyle in a way that could easily fit into our society's demanding everyday regime."3PDJHANYK6RAMVHQZ3376SHP1KL6HJ,"COSTLY CAR FOR RIDE,GOOD LOOKING MOTOR CYCLE,FULLY SECURED PUBLIC BUSES,FAST ELECTRICAL TRAINS,GOOD LOOKING BICYCLES"3PEIJLRY6U4520WBVPYX784WD0VWXD,peer to peer sharing of vehicles within a neighborhood. there is accountability with keeping the vehicles clean since it is shared within a community.3PEIJLRY6U4520WBVPYX784WDNLWXD,"A series of small, 2-seater autonomous electric vehicles designed to transport people, on call, to the regular bus routes that already run.  Think of them as the vehicular solution to the 'last mile problem'. This would allow people to completely dispose of their cars, while allowing people with little mobility to utilize the bus system.  Because the autonomous system is limited to the neighborhood -- i.e. roads where the speed limit is, at a maximum, 25 mph -- the vehicles can be pretty lightweight, since they won't have to deal with the problem of high-speed crashes.  Being autonomous, the vehicles can be used by *anyone* of any age. Because they are electrically powered, they place no additional hydrocarbons in the atmosphere.  Because they are in the neighborhoods, they place the bus system within everyone's reach.  Because everyone can use them, day or night, the number of cars on the road can be reduced substantially, thus reducing the hydrocarbon emission problem considerably.  Reducing the number of cars on the roadways make *every* neighborhood 'walkable': the dream of urban planners everywhere. The vehicles could be assembled and maintained locally, therefore  providing local employment.

Just like cars can be driven onto ferries, where a person can stay in there car while the ferry transports them across the water and then drive off the ferry onto land again once the ferry has reached its destination, drive-on subways would allow something similar. Certain stops would not be for people boarding, but for cars. The cars would go into specialized compartments and the drivers would be required to stay in their vehicles so as not to cause any danger. The cars would be allowed to drive off of the subway vehicle at certain stops too. This way, people could be using both the subway system and their cars at the same time, so they end up with the benefits of both! The subway can take them somewhere along its route, and their car can take them the rest of the way where the subway doesn't go. It would cut down on traffic and probably encourage people to take the subway even when they're not using their car. A lot of people are hesitant to try public transit, but once they try it, they find it efficient, so this would really show people how efficient it can be. While on board the subway, the people in cars would see lights in their compartment, just like a stoplight, telling them when it is okay to drive off. The doors would automatically open at every stop where cars are allowed to exit, and then a green light would go on that the driver could easily see, so they'd know it's their time to drive off. When it turns to yellow, it means the doors are closing soon, so the driver should either hurry up or choose to stay on. Of course, the doors would have motion-sensors so they wouldn't close on a car either way. There would also be maps inside each compartment with cars showing where the stops are, so a driver can prepare for where they need to get off at."3SUWZRL0MZOY2LQO92V1LPKC9AEE68,A system where cars are left with the keys in them but they require a passcode to unlock that is only obtained by renting the car.

These already exist in places like Thailand (songthaews), but we need them in my town.  This way, not everyone feels like they need a car to get around town.  Given that traffic is always a mess, we can assume there will be a cheap shared ride going in everyone's intended direction sometime soon.  You just flag one down, tell the driver where you're going, and if it's in the same general direction as the other passengers, you get in and go with them.  I think this makes more sense than having a mess of private cabs or Uber drivers going back and forth across town to take one person each time.
