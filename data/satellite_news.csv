According to the reports accompanying the bill, “the funds set aside for the RESTORE-L Pathfinder mission should lead to the immediate funding of efforts to formulate a rapid mission, done in partnership with and overseen by NASA’s existing satellite servicing expertise.” Under the mission, NASA would attempt to refuel the Landsat 7 satellite by 2019, NASA spokesman Dewayne Johnson noted in an email, “The Restore-L concept remains a study. ... As a mission concept it has not been independently funded.” Ben Reed, deputy project manager for the Satellite Servicing Capabilities Office, said Landsat 7 is the “study case. It’s owned by the government, it’s near the end of its fuel life, so we study it.”"
,57,"Space News (6/12, Gruss, Subscription Publication) reported that the Senate Appropriations Committee, like the House, is requesting no funding for the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) in its 2016 defense spending bill, and even took back $50 million allocated to launch the DMSP-F20 satellite around 2018. According to the Senate report, it is not worth the cost to store a satellite built in the 1990s when “such funds would be better spent on developing new technologies and enhancing the capabilities of the next generation of weather satellites.”"
,58,"Space News (6/8, Gruss, Subscription Publication) reports that the US House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence agreed to increase funding to the nation’s spy satellite programs in its annual intelligence authorization bill. The bill passed by a voice vote and the overall funding came in roughly one percent below the administration’s recommended budget of $53.9 billion."

,60,"Space News (5/4, Gruss, Subscription Publication) reports that according to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report, the cost of the GPS 3 program rose “by $1.1 billion in the last 12 months.” The report cautioned, “Additional delays or problems discovered during tests of the first satellite could require rework to the remaining satellites in production — carrying the risk of further cost growth.”"
,61,"The Canadian Press (4/22) reports that Canada’s Harper government announced that the country will support the ISS program through 2024. The ESA and JAXA are now the only remaining “key partners” that “have not yet committed themselves beyond 2020.” Meanwhile, according to the article, Aerospace Industries Association of Canada “praised” the government’s decision to add “an additional $30 million over four years...to support cutting-edge research and technology development in Canada’s satellite communications sector.”"
,62,"The Washington Times (3/17, Ybarra) reports that Sens. James Inhofe and Bill Nelson are “angrily accusing the Air Force of slow-walking a congressional mandate to stop using Russian rocket engines for spy satellite launches up through 2019.” The move is “driven by Capitol Hill outrage over the Kremlin’s actions in Ukraine.” The senators are “frustrated” that the Air Force has spent “less than half of the $220 million fiscal year 2015 funds that Congress has set aside for the replacement engine program.”"
,63,"Space News(3/9, de Selding, Subscription Publication) reported that CNES, the French space agency, said that it has provided $30 million for the first phase of a program to help French companies develop all-electric-propulsion satellites, “with more to come to help with in-flight technology validation.” According to the article, the “principal beneficiaries” of the money so far are Airbus Defense and Space, Thales Alenia Space, and Safran’s Snecma division. The article noted that initially, there were concerns that Boeing would “run away with the market” by being the first to develop all-electric satellites, but a lack of sales has allowed Airbus to catch up, “at least in commercial sales.”"
,64,"The Eastern Courier (NZ) (2/18, Williamson) reports that because of his efforts to make spaceflight more accessible with his Electron Launch Vehicle, Rocket Lab Chief Executive Peter Beck has been nominated for “innovator of year at the annual New Zealander of the Year Awards.” Beck claimed that the Electron Launch Vehicle should reduce “the cost of launching a satellite from $132 million to about $5m.” If successful, the vehicle could make New Zealand “the first ‘non-superpower’ country” to conduct a launch as well."
,65,"Space News (2/10, de Selding, Subscription Publication) reported that in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Google disclosed that it’s investing $900 million in SpaceX “to support continued innovation in areas of space transport, reusability and satellite manufacturing.” However, the article noted that Google devoted more space in the filing to its Project Loon, which will provide “Internet from stratospheric balloons.”"
,66,"The AP (1/20) reported that Google and Fidelity will invest a total of $1 billion into SpaceX, garnering them “a nearly 10 percent stake” in the company. The deal would increase the value of SpaceX to $10 billion. The article noted that the funds could help SpaceX conduct a manned Mars mission “within the next 12 years.” SpaceX’s mission of launching a satellite Internet program also aligns with one of Google’s projects, according to the article."
,67,"Space News (10/17, de Selding, Subscription Publication) reported that last week, the ESA formally agreed to manage Europe’s Copernicus satellite program for the European Commission for a sum of $4.1 billion between 2014 and 2020. However, the deal is “several months late in coming,” which resulted in Airbus requesting “special cash guarantees from ESA.”"
,68,"In an article that includes video on its website, the San Luis Obispo (CA) Tribune (9/25) reported that a team of California Polytechnic State University engineering graduates successfully unfurled their LightSail solar sail designed to propel their CubeSats nano-satellite technology into interplanetary missions.

,69,"“The Italian government’s agreement to commit another 66.6 million euros ($88 million) to the design of a second-generation Cosmo-SkyMed radar satellite system will keep the program moving forward but does not assure it will be completed in time to assure continuity with the first-generation system,” Space News (8/28, de Selding, Subscription Publication) reported. The Cosmo-SkyMed system is a constellation of four satellites designed to provide ground imagery at resolutions as sharp as one meter for military customers and between one meter and 100 meters for nonmilitary customers. According to the article, the country is facing “major new demands on its space budget in 2014.” For instance, Germany was “pressuring” Italy to triple its current contribution to the ISS program back to what it previously gave."
,70,"Via Satellite (8/27, Henry) profiled Delta-V, a new space industry accelerator, which wants to develop a “$1 billion commercial space industry in Australia.” The article noted that one of the projects it has worked on is SkyCube, “a crowdsourced small satellite deployed from the International Space Station (ISS) in January 2014.” According to the article, Delta-V founder Tim Parsons said it was “crucial” that Delta-V courts international markets because Australia is too small to develop a commercial space industry of its own. With officials in companies like Planet Labs and Deep Space Industries having ties to Australia, Parsons expects Australia to one day be among “the top ranks of countries involved in space.”"
,71,"Via Satellite (4/6, Henry) reported that Firefly Space Systems co-founder and COO PJ King said that the company was currently “on target” in its development of the Firefly Alpha small satellite rocket, currently scheduled to make its first launch in late 2017. An engine-firing program could start as early as May. According to the article, part of the company’s current “momentum” comes in part from a Space Act Agreement with NASA, as well as “a $1.2 million economic development grant from Texas’ City of Cedar Park Economic Development Corporation.” King stressed that when commercially produced, the rocket will be “absolutely designed for mass production.”"
,72,"The Press Trust of India (2/28) reported that India has decided to give the Department of Space a Rs 6000 crore (about $970 million) budget for 2015-2016, “with a major thrust on Launch Vehicle Technology projects.” The article noted that last year, the agency was given the same budget, but that was reduced by 25%."
,73,"The Wall Street Journal (12/2, Wall, Subscription Publication) reported that ESA Director General Jean-Jacques Dordain said that over the next three years, member states will spend about €800 million on the ISS. The ESA also approved exploration projects for the moon and Mars."
,74,"New Scientist (11/5, Marks) reported that the UK Space Agency is “inspiring” industry engineers in the UK with the possibilities of a national spaceport. Surrey Satellite Technology Limited (SSTL), a satellite company, estimates that a UK spaceport could reap revenues of £40 million per year by 2028, and the UK government believes the spaceport would act “as a hub for technology providers, space finance and insurance outfits and tourism firms.” XCOR President Andrew Nelson said that UK operations would directly and indirectly “create a number of opportunities for UK-based engineers.” Shaun Kenyon, SSTL’s R&D coordinator believes the impending spaceport is setting the UK space industry up to “take off.”"

,77,"Space News (6/9, Subscription Publication) reported that NASA Earth Science Division Director Michael Freilich told an advisory panel on May 28 that “a successor to Landsat 8” satellite could cost over $650 million, which is the cost limit Congress has imposed. While NASA is working on different architectures for the Landsat 9, none of them “fit the constraints.” Freilich said, “The problem would be a whole lot easier if we had a lot more money.” The article noted that even building an exact replica of the Landsat 8 satellite will cost too much, because as Freilich said, “Unless you design basically a block buy system ... the second copy that wasn’t planned for costs pretty much the same as the first one.”"
,78,"Space News (4/16, Ferster, Subscription Publication) reported that the Pentagon’s Operationally Response Space (ORS) Office is requesting information regarding “potential launch service providers for a small satellite that the U.S. Air Force has characterized as a potential augmentation for existing U.S. space surveillance capabilities.” The notice posted on the Federal Business Opportunities website reads, “The ORS Office is seeking capability statements from those interested launch service providers that have a proven launch vehicle that is capable of meeting the performance and cost goals.” The solicitation said the “launch vehicle must be capable of placing ORS-5, which is expected to weigh between 80 and 110 kilograms, into an equatorial orbit with an altitude of 500-700 kilometers” for a total cost of under $20 million."
,79,"The Albuquerque (NM) Journal (3/19, Brunt) reported that the Operationally Responsive Space Office, “targeted twice for closure by the Pentagon,” will now be charged with overseeing development of the ORS-2 satellite. The ORS-2 is supposed to take 30 months to build and have a 2017 launch date, all for a $60 million cost. The article noted that the $225 million ORS-1 military satellite was developed ahead of schedule, launched in 2011, and has had its lifespan extended by “at least three additional years” by the Air Force."
,80,"Space News (3/19, Werner, Subscription Publication) reported that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to release new rules this spring on crowdfunding that would allow companies to offer shares to the public as part of their campaigns, which space-related companies are likely to test out. However, because of the $1 million limits the rules would impose, companies are expected to still need to search for venture capital. Some think there are risks to the new rules benefit. For instance, Tim DeBenedictis, founder of Southern Stars, which recently had its SkyCube satellite launched from the ISS, thought it could put “nonsophisticated investors” at risk. NASA did not comment on the new rules. However, Jenn Gustetic, NASA’s Prizes and Challenges program executive, said, “While NASA does not conduct crowdfunding activities ourselves, it’s exciting to see that the nongovernment supply and demand for space related crowd funding projects is healthy and in some ways growing.”"
,81,"The Air Force Times (3/6, Everstine) reports that, as reflected in the FY 2015 budget request, declining operating costs have made the Global Hawk reconnaissance UAV more attractive relative to the U-2 for Air Force officials. The article pegs the per-flying hour costs of the Global Hawk “across all variants” at $24,000, with the aging U-2 remaining “fairly stable” at roughly $32,000. The article suggests that prior investments in the Global Hawk’s infrastructure have contributed to its improved cost effectiveness, though the UAV “still has catching up to do in terms of sensor capabilities to put it on par with the U-2.” In particular, development of Northrop Grumman’s universal payload adapter would reportedly cost roughly $487 million, though “the cost could be mitigated by the savings of using the optics from already retired U-2s.”"
,82,"The National Journal (3/5, Brown, Subscription Publication) reported that the Air Force’s budget request “preserves $2 billion to build a successor” to the Space Fence so that space vessels may be kept “safe from high-speed orbital debris.” The article noted that the Space Surveillance Network in 2012 alone “helped satellite owners make 75 maneuvers to avoid collisions,” with the Space Fence previously responsible for 40 percent of the network’s tracking. The article pointed out that the successor to the Space Fence, itself a victim of sequestration, will introduce S-band radar by 2018 that will enable the detection of thousands of smaller orbiting objects that the older Space Fence could not identify."
,83,"Reuters (3/5), meanwhile, reports on the Pentagon’s budget, which has $7.2 billion for satellites. However, the budget does not fund work on the seventh and eighth Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellites and delays work on two GPS III satellites. Officials decided to delay that work because the GPS satellites in orbit are functioning longer than expected."
,84,"The AP (3/5) reports that Facebook is in negotiations to acquire Titan Aerospace, a manufacturer of solar-powered UAVs, “to step up its efforts to provide Internet access to remote parts of the world.” Analysts suggest that the deal may be worth $60 million and is seen as furthering CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Internet.org project to connect previously omitted populations to the Internet. Titan’s voice and data communications applications for its satellite fleet were noted as being of interest to Facebook, though Zuckerberg reportedly emphasized that the more relevant obstacle to Internet access is “giving people a reason to connect.”"
,85,"Space News (2/4, de Selding, Subscription Publication) reported that, despite not being an EU member, ESA member Switzerland has secured an agreement with the EU so that it may join the Galileo satellite navigation program. The deal, which overcomes legal complications related to Switzerland’s nonmembership in the EU, stipulates that Switzerland make $108 million in back payments to the EU for not having paid dues to the program from 2008 to 2013. Annual membership fees of roughly $35 million will give the country access to government-only Public Regulated Service (PRS) signals, among other program services. The article then pointed out that EU heads of state are still considering whether to grant the U.S. Department of Defense access to the PRS signals."

,90,"Space News (11/1, Leone, Subscription Publication) reports Michael Freilich, director of NASA’s Earth Science Division, told a National Academies panel that the agency will host a payload on a commercial satellite in geostationary orbit in order to maintain “long-running Earth-system observations.” This payload will involve the Total Solar Irradiance Sensor, an instrument originally scheduled to be part of the Joint Polar Satellite System (JPSS) program, but then removed in the Administration’s 2014 budget to keep it on track. According to the article, NASA was given responsibility for collecting this information, as well as data from other devices dropped from the JPSS, “at a fraction of what NOAA estimated the job would cost.” Freilich said the budget “generously gave us $40 million in one year to do that.” The article notes NASA is copying the Ozone Mapping Profiler Suite instrument and an “open competition” for the Clouds and Earth’s Radiant Energy System to continue gathering that data inexpensively."

This trend gained ""momentum in 2006, after Pentagon and intelligence officials canceled a big chunk of work on a troubled Boeing spy-satellite contract"" which was $5 billion over budget."
,407,"The Wall Street Journal(12/7, Pasztor, subscription required) reports, ""U.S. intelligence agencies are quietly spending about $7.5 billion to build a pair of older-technology spy satellites...at a time when more-technically-advanced military satellite projects are faltering because of budget cuts.""

,408," While the plans only call for two ground stations ""near Munich and...Rome"" to service the satellite network s functions and transmissions, ""Spain demanded"" its own ""ground station in the network"" during ""an EU transport ministers meeting."" With a €2.4 billion budget that will mostly ""come from unused...farm funds,"" the EU "" just [doesn t] have the money for a third ground station,  said an EU diplomat."" Dominique Bussereau, the French state secretary of transport, ""suggested Spain be given a Galileo test center."""
,409,"Space News (11/27, De Selding) reports that European government officials say the Galileo satellite navigation project ""passed a major test of government financial support and now is considered likely to be given final approval Nov. 29-30 during a meeting of European transport ministers"" as ""European economics and finance ministers, along with the European Parliament, endorsed the idea that the €2.4 billion ($3.6 billion) still needed to build and deploy the 30-satellite constellation would be taken mainly from unused farm-support funds."""
,410,"Bloomberg (11/12, Deen) reported that the British Parliament Transport Committee said Europe s Galileo satellite program, which was ""designed to rival the American global positioning system, should be scrapped unless its sponsors can prove it is economically viable."" In May, the EU ""nearly doubled the estimated subsidy needed to launch the navigation system to €4.5 billion ($6.6 billion) from about €2.4 billion. "
,411,"The New York Times(11/11, Taubman) reported on the history of a failed spy satellite program called Future Imagery Architecture, to which the government allotted $5 billion for development in 1998. "
,412," The result was ""the most spectacular and expensive failure in the 50-year history of American spy satellite projects,"" costing an estimated $18 billion, and highlighting ""weaknesses in the government s ability to manage complex contracts at a time when military and intelligence contracting is soaring."""
,413,"However, there was ""no further discussion"" regarding ""more information about the anti-satellite test the Chinese conducted in January, Gates"" said. The test, in which a ""missile shattered a defunct Chinese weather satellite,"" generated ""immediate criticism from the U.S. and other countries, who questioned China s commitment to peaceful development in space."" Of particular concern to the U.S. is China s military spending, which ""increased by about 17.8 percent to about $45 billion this year,"" as well as a lack of transparency in that spending."
,414,"The Long Island Newsday (11/4, Ritea) reported, ""Satellite technology is the next  quantum leap  in tracking aircraft, a development that officials say will significantly diminish flight delays plaguing the nation s major airports."" By 2013 the FAA ""plans to jettison antiquated ground radar systems and replace them with a satellite system that utilizes a Global Positioning System to track planes, officials say. All commercial planes should be using the system -- estimated to cost up to $22 billion -- by 2020."" "
,415," The Guardian noted, ""Williams believes emerging markets are an important opportunity, with a £100m satellite capable of providing the same communications services that would cost tens of billions if they were hard-wired."""
